{"title": "Towards Stability Analysis of Data Transport Mechanisms: A Fluid Model and an Application.", "fields": ["transmission control protocol", "equivalence", "stability theory", "tcp congestion avoidance algorithm", "congestion window"], "abstract": "The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) utilizes congestion avoidance and control mechanisms as a preventive measure against congestive collapse and as an adaptive measure in the presence of changing network conditions. The set of available congestion control algorithms is diverse, and while many have been studied from empirical and simulation perspectives, there is a notable lack of analytical work for some variants. To gain more insight into the dynamics of these algorithms, we: (1) propose a general modeling scheme consisting of a set of functional differential equations of retarded type (RFDEs) and of the congestion window as a function of time; (2) apply this scheme to TCP Reno and demonstrate its equivalence to a previous, well known model for TCP Reno; (3) show an application of the new framework to the widely-deployed congestion control algorithm TCP CUBIC, for which analytical models are few and limited; and (4) validate the model using simulations. Our modeling framework yields a fluid model for TCP CUBIC. From a theoretical analysis of this model, we discover that TCP CUBIC is locally uniformly asymptotically stable -- a property of the algorithm previously unknown.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "authors": ["Gayane Vardoyan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vardoyan:Gayane", "C.
