{"title": "Stop-and-Stare: Optimal Sampling Algorithms for Viral Marketing in Billion-scale Networks.", "fields": ["small set", "maximization", "gibbs sampling", "viral marketing", "cascading failure"], "abstract": "Influence Maximization (IM), that seeks a small set of key users who spread the influence widely into the network, is a core problem in multiple domains. It finds applications in viral marketing, epidemic control, and assessing cascading failures within complex systems. Despite the huge amount of effort, IM in billion-scale networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and World Wide Web has not been satisfactorily solved. Even the state-of-the-art methods such as TIM+ and IMM may take days on those networks. In this paper, we propose SSA and D-SSA, two novel sampling frameworks for IM-based viral marketing problems. SSA and D-SSA are up to 1200 times faster than the SIGMOD'15 best method, IMM, while providing the same (1-1/e-e) approximation guarantee. Underlying our frameworks is an innovative Stop-and-Stare strategy in which they stop at exponential check points to verify (stare) if there is adequate statistical evidence on the solution quality. Theoretically, we prove that SSA and D-SSA are the first approximation algorithms that use (asymptotically) minimum numbers of samples, meeting strict theoretical thresholds characterized for IM. The absolute superiority of SSA and D-SSA are confirmed through extensive experiments on real network data for IM and another topic-aware viral marketing problem, named TVM.", "citation": "Citations (57)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Virginia Commonwealth University", "University of Florida", "Virginia Commonwealth University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Hung T.
