{"title": "Stack-Pointer Networks for Dependency Parsing.", "fields": ["tree", "call stack", "pointer", "parse tree", "dependency grammar"], "abstract": "We introduce a novel architecture for dependency parsing: \\emph{stack-pointer networks} (\\textbf{\\textsc{StackPtr}}). Combining pointer networks~\\citep{vinyals2015pointer} with an internal stack, the proposed model first reads and encodes the whole sentence, then builds the dependency tree top-down (from root-to-leaf) in a depth-first fashion. The stack tracks the status of the depth-first search and the pointer networks select one child for the word at the top of the stack at each step. The \\textsc{StackPtr} parser benefits from the information of the whole sentence and all previously derived subtree structures, and removes the left-to-right restriction in classical transition-based parsers. Yet, the number of steps for building any (including non-projective) parse tree is linear in the length of the sentence just as other transition-based parsers, yielding an efficient decoding algorithm with $O(n^2)$ time complexity. We evaluate our model on 29 treebanks spanning 20 languages and different dependency annotation schemas, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on 21 of them.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Southern California", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Eduard H.
