Until now different attempts had been made to build a BRF in a  transductive  setting, in which the test points are given to the methods in advance as unlabeled data. The proposed approach is a semi-supervised  inductive  ranking algorithm which, as opposed to transductive algorithms, is able to infer an ordering on new examples that were not used for its training. We evaluate our approach using the TREC-9 Ohsumed and the Reuters-21578 data collections, comparing against two semi-supervised classification algorithms for ROCArea (AUC), uninterpolated average precision (AUP), mean precision@50 (TP) and Precision-Recall (PR) curves. In the most interesting cases where there are an unbalanced number of irrelevant examples over relevant ones, we show our method to produce statistically significant improvements with respect to these ranking measures.", "citation": "Citations (71)", "departments": ["Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University", "Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University", "National Research Council"], "authors": ["Massih-Reza Amini.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Amini:Massih=Reza", "Tuong-Vinh Truong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Truong:Tuong=Vinh", "Cyril Goutte.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goutte:Cyril"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2008", "pages": 8}
