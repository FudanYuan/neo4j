{"title": "Soft Layer-Specific Multi-Task Summarization with Entailment and Question Generation.", "fields": ["logical consequence", "machine learning", "automatic summarization", "salience", "encoder"], "abstract": "An accurate abstractive summary of a document should contain all its salient information and should be logically entailed by the input document. We improve these important aspects of abstractive summarization via multi-task learning with the auxiliary tasks of question generation and entailment generation, where the former teaches the summarization model how to look for salient questioning-worthy details, and the latter teaches the model how to rewrite a summary which is a directed-logical subset of the input document. We also propose novel multi-task architectures with high-level (semantic) layer-specific sharing across multiple encoder and decoder layers of the three tasks, as well as soft-sharing mechanisms (and show performance ablations and analysis examples of each contribution). Overall, we achieve statistically significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on both the CNN/DailyMail and Gigaword datasets, as well as on the DUC-2002 transfer setup. We also present several quantitative and qualitative analysis studies of our model's learned saliency and entailment skills.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Mohit Bansal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bansal:Mohit", "Ramakanth Pasunuru.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pasunuru:Ramakanth", "Han Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Han"], "pages": 11}
