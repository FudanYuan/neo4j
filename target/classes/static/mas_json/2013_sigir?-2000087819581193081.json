Unlike previous works which focus on labeled data from user-contributed reviews, we focus here on user comments which are not accompanied by explicit rating labels. We investigate their utility for a one-class collaborative filtering task such as bookmarking, where only the user actions are given as ground truth. We propose a sentiment-aware nearest neighbor model (SANN) for multimedia recommendations over TED talks, which makes use of user comments. The model outperforms significantly, by more than 25% on unseen data, several competitive baselines.", "citation": "Citations (28)", "departments": ["Idiap Research Institute", "Idiap Research Institute"], "authors": ["Nikolaos Pappas.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pappas:Nikolaos", "Andrei Popescu-Belis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Popescu=Belis:Andrei"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
