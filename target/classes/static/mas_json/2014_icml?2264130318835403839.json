We propose a fast non-iterative approximate inference method that uses a feedforward network to implement efficient exact sampling from the variational posterior. The model and this inference network are trained jointly by maximizing a variational lower bound on the log-likelihood. Although the naive estimator of the inference network gradient is too high-variance to be useful, we make it practical by applying several straightforward model-independent variance reduction techniques. Applying our approach to training sigmoid belief networks and deep autoregressive networks, we show that it outperforms the wake-sleep algorithm on MNIST and achieves state-of-the-art results on the Reuters RCV1 document dataset.", "citation": "Citations (297)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Google", "Google"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Andriy Mnih.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mnih:Andriy", "Karol Gregor.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gregor:Karol"], "pages": 9}
