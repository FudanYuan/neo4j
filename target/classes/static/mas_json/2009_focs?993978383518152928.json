{"title": "The Quantum and Classical Complexity of Translationally Invariant Tiling and Hamiltonian Problems.", "fields": ["hamiltonian", "combinatorics", "nexptime", "quantum mechanics", "mathematics", "quantum computer", "discrete mathematics", "quantum", "invariant", "quantum system"], "abstract": "We study the complexity of a class of problems involving satisfying constraints which remain the same under translations in one or more spatial directions. In this paper, we show hardness of a classical tiling problem on an (N x N) 2-dimensional grid and a quantum problem involving finding the ground state energy of a 1-dimensional quantum system of N particles. In both cases, the only input is N, provided in binary. We show that the classical problem is NEXP-complete and the quantum problem is QMAEXP-complete. Thus, an algorithm for these problems that runs in time polynomial in N (exponential in the input size) would imply EXP = NEXP or BQEXP = QMAEXP, respectively. Although tiling in general is already known to be NEXP-complete, to our knowledge, all previous reductions require that either the set of tiles and their constraints or some varying boundary conditions be given as part of the input. In the problem considered here, these are fixed, constant-sized parameters of the problem. Instead, the problem instance is encoded solely in the size of the system.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics", "University of California, Irvine"], "authors": ["Daniel Gottesman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gottesman:Daniel", "Sandy Irani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Irani:Sandy"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
