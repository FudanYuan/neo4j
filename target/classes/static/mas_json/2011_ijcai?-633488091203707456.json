In this paper, we show that there are deeper reasons for choosing a conjugate prior. Specifically, we formulate the conjugate prior in the form of Bregman divergence and show that it is the inherent geometry of conjugate priors that makes them appropriate and intuitive. This geometric interpretation allows one to view the hyperparameters of conjugate priors as the effective sample points, thus providing additional intuition. We use this geometric understanding of conjugate priors to derive the hyperparameters and expression of the prior used to couple the generative and discriminative components of a hybrid model for semi-supervised learning.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Utah", "University of Utah", "University of Maryland, College Park", "University of Maryland, College Park"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Arvind Agarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwal:Arvind", "Hal Daum\u00e9 III.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Daum=eacute=_III:Hal"], "pages": 6}
