Analyzing and predicting convincingness of Web arguments using bidirectional LSTM.", "fields": ["ranking", "natural language processing", "argumentation theory", "support vector machine", "software"], "abstract": "We propose a new task in the field of computational argumentation in which we investigate qualitative properties of Web arguments, namely their convincingness. We cast the problem as relation classification, where a pair of arguments having the same stance to the same prompt is judged. We annotate a large datasets of 16k pairs of arguments over 32 topics and investigate whether the relation \u201cA is more convincing than B\u201d exhibits properties of total ordering; these findings are used as global constraints for cleaning the crowdsourced data. We propose two tasks: (1) predicting which argument from an argument pair is more convincing and (2) ranking all arguments to the topic based on their convincingness. We experiment with feature-rich SVM and bidirectional LSTM and obtain 0.76-0.78 accuracy and 0.35-0.40 Spearman\u2019s correlation in a cross-topic evaluation. We release the newly created corpus UKPConvArg1 and the experimental software under open licenses.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Ivan Habernal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Habernal:Ivan", "Iryna Gurevych.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gurevych:Iryna"], "pages": -1}
