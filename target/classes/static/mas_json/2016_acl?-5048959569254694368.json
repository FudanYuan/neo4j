While shallow methods like relation extraction are robust to data scarcity, they are less expressive than the deep meaning representation methods like semantic parsing, thereby failing at answering questions involving multiple constraints. Here we alleviate this problem by empowering a relation extraction method with additional evidence from Wikipedia. We first present a neural network based relation extractor to retrieve the candidate answers from Freebase, and then infer over Wikipedia to validate these answers. Experiments on the WebQuestions question answering dataset show that our method achieves an F_1 of 53.3%, a substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art.", "citation": "Citations (60)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Peking University", "University of Edinburgh", "Peking University", "Peking University", "Peking University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Kun Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Kun", "Siva Reddy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reddy:Siva", "Yansong Feng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feng:Yansong", "Songfang Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Songfang", "Dongyan Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Dongyan"], "pages": -1}
