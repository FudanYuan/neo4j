{"title": "Unsupervised One-Class Learning for Automatic Outlier Removal.", "fields": ["ransac", "semi supervised learning", "training set", "unsupervised learning", "outlier"], "abstract": "Outliers are pervasive in many computer vision and pattern recognition problems. Automatically eliminating outliers scattering among practical data collections becomes increasingly important, especially for Internet inspired vision applications. In this paper, we propose a novel one-class learning approach which is robust to contamination of input training data and able to discover the outliers that corrupt one class of data source. Our approach works under a fully unsupervised manner, differing from traditional one-class learning supervised by known positive labels. By design, our approach optimizes a kernel-based max-margin objective which jointly learns a large margin one-class classifier and a soft label assignment for inliers and outliers. An alternating optimization algorithm is then designed to iteratively refine the classifier and the labeling, achieving a provably convergent solution in only a few iterations. Extensive experiments conducted on four image datasets in the presence of artificial and real-world outliers demonstrate that the proposed approach is considerably superior to the state-of-the-arts in obliterating outliers from contaminated one class of images, exhibiting strong robustness at a high outlier proportion up to 60%.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Wei Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0005:Wei", "Gang Hua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hua:Gang", "John R.
