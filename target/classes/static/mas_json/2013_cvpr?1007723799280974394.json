{"title": "Improving Image Matting Using Comprehensive Sampling Sets.", "fields": ["pattern recognition", "computer vision", "background subtraction", "pixel", "sampling"], "abstract": "In this paper, we present a new image matting algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark dataset of images. This is achieved by solving two major problems encountered by current sampling based algorithms. The first is that the range in which the foreground and background are sampled is often limited to such an extent that the true foreground and background colors are not present. Here, we describe a method by which a more comprehensive and representative set of samples is collected so as not to miss out on the true samples. This is accomplished by expanding the sampling range for pixels farther from the foreground or background boundary and ensuring that samples from each color distribution are included. The second problem is the overlap in color distributions of foreground and background regions. This causes sampling based methods to fail to pick the correct samples for foreground and background. Our design of an objective function forces those foreground and background samples to be picked that are generated from well-separated distributions. Comparison on the dataset at and evaluation by www.alphamatting.com shows that the proposed method ranks first in terms of error measures used in the website.", "citation": "Citations (88)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Adobe Systems", "Adobe Systems"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Ehsan Shahrian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shahrian:Ehsan", "Deepu Rajan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rajan:Deepu", "Brian L.
