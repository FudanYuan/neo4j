The algorithms are all based on a novel LP formulation for capacity problems. First, we give a new constant-factor approximation algorithm for selecting the maximum subset of links that can be scheduled simultaneously, under any non-decreasing and sublinear power assignment. For the case of uniform power, we extend this to the case of variable QoS requirements and link-dependent noise terms. Second, we approximate a problem related to cognitive radio: find a maximum set of links that can be simultaneously scheduled without affecting a given set of previously assigned links. Finally, we obtain constant-factor approximation of weighted capacity under linear power assignment.", "citation": "Citations (31)", "departments": ["Reykjav\u00edk University", "Reykjav\u00edk University"], "authors": ["Magn\u00fas M.
