For these two problems, the common theme is how to \u2018match\u2019 an arriving left vertex in an online fashion with any of the available right vertices, if at all, so as to maximize the sum of the value of the matched edges, subject to satisfying a sum-weight constraint on the matched left vertices. Assuming that the left vertices arrive in an uniformly random order (secretary model), two almost similar algorithms are proposed for the two problems, that are 2e competitive and 24 competitive, respectively. The proposed online bipartite matching algorithm is also shown to be truthful: there is no incentive for any left vertex to misreport its bid/weight. Direct applications of these problems include job allocation with load balancing, generalized adwords, crowdsourcing auctions, and matching wireless users to cooperative relays in device-to-device communication enabled cellular network.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Tata Institute of Fundamental Research"], "authors": ["Rahul Vaze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vaze:Rahul"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
