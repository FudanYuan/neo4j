{"title": "Computing Optimal Coverability Costs in Priced Timed Petri Nets.", "fields": ["infimum and supremum", "stochastic petri net", "security token", "formal verification", "automata theory"], "abstract": "We consider timed Petri nets, i.e., unbounded Petri nets where each token carries a real-valued clock. Transition arcs are labeled with time intervals, which specify constraints on the ages of tokens. Our cost model assigns token storage costs per time unit to places, and firing costs to transitions. We study the cost to reach a given control-state. In general, a cost-optimal run may not exist. However, we show that the infimum of the costs is computable.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Uppsala University", "University of Edinburgh"], "authors": ["Parosh Aziz Abdulla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abdulla:Parosh_Aziz", "Richard Mayr.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mayr:Richard"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
