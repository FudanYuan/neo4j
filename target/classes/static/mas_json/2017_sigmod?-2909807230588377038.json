{"title": "Leveraging Re-costing for Online Optimization of Parameterized Queries with Guarantees.", "fields": ["bounded function", "sql", "small number", "parameterized complexity", "overhead"], "abstract": "Parametric query optimization (PQO) deals with the problem of finding and reusing a relatively small number of plans that can achieve good plan quality across multiple instances of a parameterized query. An ideal solution to PQO would process query instances  online  and ensure (a) tight, bounded cost sub-optimality for each instance, (b) low optimization overheads, and (c) only a small number of plans need to be stored. Existing solutions to online PQO however, fall short on at least one of the above metrics. We propose a plan re-costing based approach that enables us to perform well on all three metrics. We empirically show the effectiveness of our technique on industry benchmark and real-world query workloads with our modified version of the Microsoft SQL Server query optimizer.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Anshuman Dutt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dutt:Anshuman", "Vivek R.
