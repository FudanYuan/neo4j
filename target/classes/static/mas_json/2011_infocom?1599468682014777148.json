A request originates in a source access network (also called collection network) and include multiple destinations in different access networks (also called distribution networks). We call them together as collection-distribution networks (CDN). The connection points between a CDN and the core network is an edge node which can groom several multicast connections together. In such an architecture, given a set of multicast requests, our goal is to maximize the amount of multicast destinations and bandwidth served. Therefore, we formulate an optimization problem with an objective of maximizing the product of bandwidth-number of destinations according to partial multicast service discipline. We show that this is an NP-hard problem and present a suboptimal and a heuristic algorithm. We develop a lower bound on the performance. We present numerical results and show that our algorithms achieve a very close performance to the lower bound.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Iowa State University", "Indian Institute of Technology Delhi"], "authors": ["Onur Turkcu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Turkcu:Onur", "Arun K.
