{"title": "That's sick dude!: Automatic identification of word sense change across different timescales.", "fields": ["word sense", "word sense disambiguation", "lexicography", "wordnet", "semantic search"], "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method to identify noun sense changes based on rigorous analysis of time-varying text data available in the form of millions of digitized books. We construct distributional thesauri based networks from data at different time points and cluster each of them separately to obtain word-centric sense clusters corresponding to the different time points. Subsequently, we compare these sense clusters of two different time points to find if (i) there is birth of a new sense or (ii) if an older sense has got split into more than one sense or (iii) if a newer sense has been formed from the joining of older senses or (iv) if a particular sense has died. We conduct a thorough evaluation of the proposed methodology both manually as well as through comparison with WordNet. Manual evaluation indicates that the algorithm could correctly identify 60.4% birth cases from a set of 48 randomly picked samples and 57% split/join cases from a set of 21 randomly picked samples. Remarkably, in 44% cases the birth of a novel sense is attested by WordNet, while in 46% cases and 43% cases split and join are respectively confirmed by WordNet. Our approach can be applied for lexicography, as well as for applications like word sense disambiguation or semantic search.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur", "Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Sunny Mitra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mitra:Sunny", "Ritwik Mitra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mitra:Ritwik", "Martin Riedl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Riedl_0002:Martin", "Chris Biemann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Biemann:Chris", "Animesh Mukherjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mukherjee_0001:Animesh", "Pawan Goyal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goyal:Pawan"], "pages": 10}
