In this paper, we propose, implement, and evaluate fully automated methods for proving security of ABE in the Generic Bilinear Group Model (Boneh, Boyen, and Goh, 2005, Boyen, 2008), an idealized model which admits simpler and more efficient constructions, and can also be used to find attacks. Our method is applicable to Rational-Fraction Induced ABE, a large class of ABE that contains most of the schemes from the literature, and relies on a Master Theorem, which reduces security in the GGM to a (new) notion of symbolic security, which is amenable to automated verification using constraint-based techniques. We relate our notion of symbolic security for Rational-Fraction Induced ABE to prior notions for Pair Encodings. Finally, we present several applications, including automated proofs for new schemes.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Technical University of Madrid", "IMDEA", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Miguel Ambrona.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Ambrona:Miguel", "Gilles Barthe.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Barthe:Gilles", "Romain Gay.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gay:Romain", "Hoeteck Wee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wee:Hoeteck"], "pages": 18}
