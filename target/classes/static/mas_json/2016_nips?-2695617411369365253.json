{"title": "Towards Unifying Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Slice Sampling.", "fields": ["monomial", "hamiltonian mechanics", "slice sampling", "synthetic data", "hybrid monte carlo"], "abstract": "We unify slice sampling and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling, demonstrating their connection via the Hamiltonian-Jacobi equation from Hamiltonian mechanics. This insight enables extension of HMC and slice sampling to a broader family of samplers, called Monomial Gamma Samplers (MGS). We provide a theoretical analysis of the mixing performance of such samplers, proving that in the limit of a single parameter, the MGS draws decorrelated samples from the desired target distribution. We further show that as this parameter tends toward this limit, performance gains are achieved at a cost of increasing numerical difficulty and some practical convergence issues. Our theoretical results are validated with synthetic data and real-world applications.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "departments": ["Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University", "Duke University"], "authors": ["Yizhe Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yizhe", "Xiangyu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Xiangyu", "Changyou Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Changyou", "Ricardo Henao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Henao:Ricardo", "Kai Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Kai", "Lawrence Carin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carin:Lawrence"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
