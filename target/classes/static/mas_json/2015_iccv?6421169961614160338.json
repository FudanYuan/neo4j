{"title": "Rendering of Eyes for Eye-Shape Registration and Gaze Estimation.", "fields": ["rendering", "training set", "gaze", "annotation", "controllability"], "abstract": "Images of the eye are key in several computer vision problems, such as shape registration and gaze estimation. Recent large-scale supervised methods for these problems require time-consuming data collection and manual annotation, which can be unreliable. We propose synthesizing perfectly labelled photo-realistic training data in a fraction of the time. We used computer graphics techniques to build a collection of dynamic eye-region models from head scan geometry. These were randomly posed to synthesize close-up eye images for a wide range of head poses, gaze directions, and illumination conditions. We used our model's controllability to verify the importance of realistic illumination and shape variations in eye-region training data. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of our synthesized training data (SynthesEyes) by out-performing state-of-the-art methods for eye-shape registration as well as cross-dataset appearance-based gaze estimation in the wild.", "citation": "Citations (64)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "University of Cambridge"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Erroll Wood.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wood:Erroll", "Tadas Baltrusaitis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baltrusaitis:Tadas", "Xucong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xucong", "Yusuke Sugano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sugano:Yusuke", "Peter Robinson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Robinson_0001:Peter", "Andreas Bulling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bulling:Andreas"], "pages": 9}
