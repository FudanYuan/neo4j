More than two decades after its introduction it is still the algorithm of choice even in the restricted model where processing times are of the form $p_{ij} \\in \\{p_j, \\infty\\}$. This problem, also known as the restricted assignment problem, is NP-hard to approximate within a factor less than $1.5$, which is also the best known lower bound for the general version. Our main result is a polynomial time algorithm that estimates the optimal makespan of the restricted assignment problem within a factor $33/17 + \\epsilon \\approx 1.9412 + \\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon > 0$ is an arbitrarily small constant. The result is obtained by upper bounding the integrality gap of a certain strong linear program, known as the configuration LP, that was previously successfu...", "citation": "Citations (71)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Royal Institute of Technology"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Ola Svensson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Svensson:Ola"], "pages": 10}
