In such cases, curiosity can serve as an intrinsic reward signal to enable the agent to explore its environment and learn skills that might be useful later in its life. We formulate curiosity as the error in an agent's ability to predict the consequence of its own actions in a visual feature space learned by a self-supervised inverse dynamics model. Our formulation scales to high-dimensional continuous state spaces like images, bypasses the difficulties of directly predicting pixels, and, critically, ignores the aspects of the environment that cannot affect the agent. The proposed approach is evaluated in two environments: VizDoom and Super Mario Bros. Three broad settings are investigated: 1) sparse extrinsic reward; 2) exploration with no extrinsic reward; and 3) generalization to unseen scenarios (e.g. new levels of the same game).", "citation": "Citations (114)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Deepak Pathak.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pathak:Deepak", "Pulkit Agrawal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agrawal:Pulkit", "Alexei A.
