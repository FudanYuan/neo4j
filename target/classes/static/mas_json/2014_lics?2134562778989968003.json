Taking inspiration from the recent introduction of scope-bounded multi-stack push-down systems, we define  Senescent Ground Tree Rewrite Systems . These are a restriction of ground tree rewrite systems with state such that nodes of the tree may no longer be rewritten after having witnessed an  a priori  fixed number of control state changes. As well as generalising scope-bounded multi-stack pushdown systems, we show --- via reductions to and from reset Petri-nets --- that these systems have an Ackermann-complete control state reachability problem. However, reachability of a regular set of trees remains undecidable.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Royal Holloway, University of London"], "authors": ["Matthew Hague.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hague:Matthew"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
