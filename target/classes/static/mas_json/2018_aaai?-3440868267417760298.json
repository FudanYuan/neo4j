{"title": "DLPaper2Code: Auto-Generation of Code From Deep Learning Research Papers.", "fields": ["implementation", "deep learning", "data flow diagram", "extensibility", "design flow"], "abstract": "With an abundance of research papers in deep learning, reproducibility or adoption of the existing works becomes a challenge. This is due to the lack of open source implementations provided by the authors. Further, re-implementing research papers in a different library is a daunting task. To address these challenges, we propose a novel extensible approach, DLPaper2Code, to extract and understand deep learning design flow diagrams and tables available in a research paper and convert them to an abstract computational graph. The extracted computational graph is then converted into execution ready source code in both Keras and Caffe, in real-time. An arXiv-like website is created where the automatically generated designs is made publicly available for 5,000 research papers. The generated designs could be rated and edited using an intuitive drag-and-drop UI framework in a crowdsourced manner. To evaluate our approach, we create a simulated dataset with over 216,000 valid design visualizations using a manually defined grammar. Experiments on the simulated dataset show that the proposed framework provide more than $93\\%$ accuracy in flow diagram content extraction.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["IBM", "IBM", "IBM", "IBM"], "authors": ["Akshay Sethi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sethi:Akshay", "Anush Sankaran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sankaran:Anush", "Naveen Panwar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Panwar:Naveen", "Shreya Khare.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khare:Shreya", "Senthil Mani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mani:Senthil"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
