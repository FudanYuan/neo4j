Using ELF, we implement a highly customizable real-time strategy (RTS) engine with three game environments (Mini-RTS, Capture the Flag and Tower Defense). Mini-RTS, as a miniature version of StarCraft, captures key game dynamics and runs at 165K frame-per-second (FPS) on a laptop. When coupled with modern reinforcement learning methods, the system can train a full-game bot against built-in AIs end-to-end in one day with 6 CPUs and 1 GPU. In addition, our platform is flexible in terms of environment-agent communication topologies, choices of RL methods, changes in game parameters, and can host existing C/C++-based game environments like ALE. Using ELF, we thoroughly explore training parameters and show that a network with Leaky ReLU and Batch Normalization coupled with long-horizon training and progressive curriculum beats the rule-based built-in AI more than 70% of the time in the full game of Mini-RTS. Strong performance is also achieved on the other two games. In game replays, we show our agents learn interesting strategies. ELF, along with its RL platform, is open-sourced at https://github.com/facebookresearch/ELF.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Facebook", "Facebook", "Facebook", "Facebook", "435024885627"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Yuandong Tian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tian:Yuandong", "Qucheng Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Qucheng", "Wenling Shang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shang:Wenling", "Yuxin Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Yuxin", "C.
