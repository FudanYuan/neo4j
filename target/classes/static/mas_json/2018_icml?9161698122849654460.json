One attractive viewpoint on ResNet is that it is optimizing the risk in a functional space by combining an ensemble of effective features. In this paper, we adopt this viewpoint to construct a new gradient boosting method, which is known to be very powerful in data analysis. To do so, we formalize the gradient boosting perspective of ResNet mathematically using the notion of functional gradients and propose a new method called ResFGB for classification tasks by leveraging ResNet perception. Two types of generalization guarantees are provided from the optimization perspective: one is the margin bound and the other is the expected risk bound by the sample-splitting technique. Experimental results show superior performance of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods such as LightGBM.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "authors": ["Atsushi Nitanda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nitanda:Atsushi", "Taiji Suzuki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suzuki:Taiji"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
