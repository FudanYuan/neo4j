We propose a novel Autoencoder Regularized deep neural Network (ARNet) and a trip encoding framework trip2vec to learn drivers' driving styles directly from GPS records, by combining supervised and unsupervised feature learning in a unified architecture. Experiments on a challenging driver number estimation problem and the driver identification problem show that ARNet can learn a good generalized driving style representation: It significantly outperforms existing methods and alternative architectures by reaching the least estimation error on average (0.68, less than one driver) and the highest identification accuracy (by at least 3% improvement) compared with traditional supervised learning methods.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["IBM", "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"], "authors": ["Weishan Dong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dong:Weishan", "Ting Yuan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yuan:Ting", "Kai Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Kai", "Changsheng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Changsheng", "Shilei Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Shilei"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
