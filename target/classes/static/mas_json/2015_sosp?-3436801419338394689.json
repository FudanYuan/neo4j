{"title": "Parallelizing user-defined aggregations using symbolic execution.", "fields": ["associative property", "software quality", "expression", "symbolic execution", "state machine replication"], "abstract": "User-defined aggregations (UDAs) are integral to large-scale data-processing systems, such as MapReduce and Hadoop, because they let programmers express application-specific aggregation logic. System-supported associative aggregations, such as counting or finding the maximum, are data-parallel and thus these systems optimize their execution, leading in many cases to orders-of-magnitude performance improvements. These optimizations, however, are not possible on arbitrary UDAs.   This paper presents S ymple , a system for performing MapReduce-style groupby-aggregate queries that automatically parallelizes UDAs. Users specify UDAs using stylized C++ code  with  possible loop-carried dependences. S ymple  parallelizes these UDAs by breaking dependences using symbolic execution, where unresolved dependences are treated as symbolic values and the S ymple  runtime partially evaluates the resulting symbolic expressions on concrete input. Programmers write UDAs using S ymple 's symbolic data types, which look and behave like standard C++ types. These data types (i) encode specialized decision procedures for efficient symbolic execution and (ii) generate compact symbolic expressions for efficient network transfers. Evaluation on both Amazon's Elastic cloud and a private 380-node Hadoop cluster housing terabytes of data demonstrates that S ymple  reduces network communication up to several orders of magnitude and job latency by as much as 5.9x for a representative set of queries.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Veselin Raychev.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raychev:Veselin", "Madanlal Musuvathi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Musuvathi:Madanlal", "Todd Mytkowicz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mytkowicz:Todd"], "conf": "sosp", "year": "2015", "pages": 15}
