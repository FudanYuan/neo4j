To better understand this collaboration and how tool support can be improved, we have quantitatively and qualitatively analysed the questions asked in a sample of 600 bug reports from the MOZILLA and ECLIPSE projects. We categorised the questions and analysed response rates and times by category and project. Our results show that the role of users goes beyond simply reporting bugs: their active and ongoing participation is important for making progress on the bugs they report. Based on the results, we suggest four ways in which bug tracking systems can be improved.", "citation": "Citations (177)", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "VU University Amsterdam", "University of Calgary", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Silvia Breu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Breu:Silvia", "Rahul Premraj.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Premraj:Rahul", "Jonathan Sillito.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sillito:Jonathan", "Thomas Zimmermann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zimmermann_0001:Thomas"], "conf": "cscw", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
