{"title": "An End-to-end Approach for Handling Unknown Slot Values in Dialogue State Tracking.", "fields": ["empirical evidence", "spoken language", "pointer", "end to end principle", "architecture"], "abstract": "We highlight a practical yet rarely discussed problem in dialogue state tracking (DST), namely handling unknown slot values. Previous approaches generally assume predefined candidate lists and thus are not designed to output unknown values, especially when the spoken language understanding (SLU) module is absent as in many end-to-end (E2E) systems. We describe in this paper an E2E architecture based on the pointer network (PtrNet) that can effectively extract unknown slot values while still obtains state-of-the-art accuracy on the standard DSTC2 benchmark. We also provide extensive empirical evidence to show that tracking unknown values can be challenging and our approach can bring significant improvement with the help of an effective feature dropout technique.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": [], "authors": ["Puyang Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Puyang", "Qi Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Qi"], "conf": "acl", "year": "2018", "pages": 10}
