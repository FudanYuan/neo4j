The single most effective way to improve application launch performance is to replace a hard disk drive (HDD) with a solid state drive (SSD), which has recently become affordable and popular. A natural question is then whether or not to replace the traditional HDD-aware application launchers with a new SSD-aware optimizer.\n\nWe address this question by analyzing the inefficiency of the HDD-aware application launchers on SSDs and then proposing a new SSD-aware application prefetching scheme, called the Fast Application STarter (FAST). The key idea of FAST is to overlap the computation (CPU) time with the SSD access (I/O) time during an application launch. FAST is composed of a set of user-level components and system debugging tools provided by the Linux OS (operating system). In addition, FAST uses a system-call wrapper to automatically detect application launches. Hence, FAST can be easily deployed in any recent Linux versions without kernel recompilation. We implemented FAST on a desktop PC with a SSD running Linux 2.6.32 OS and evaluated it by launching a set of widely-used applications, demonstrating an average of 28% reduction of application launch time as compared to PC without a prefetcher.", "citation": "Citations (93)", "departments": ["Ewha Womans University", "Seoul National University", "Ewha Womans University", "University of Michigan"], "authors": ["Yongsoo Joo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Joo:Yongsoo", "Junhee Ryu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ryu:Junhee", "Sangsoo Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Sangsoo", "Kang G.
