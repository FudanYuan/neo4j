Recently, a few breakthroughs have been discovered on $k$-SVD: Musco and Musco [1] provided the first gap-free theorem for the block Krylov method, Shamir [2] discovered the first variance-reduction stochastic method, and Bhojanapalli et al. [3] provided the fastest $O(nnz(A) + poly(1/eps))$-type of algorithm using alternating minimization. In this paper, we improve the above breakthroughs by providing a new framework for solving k-SVD. In particular, we obtain faster gap-free convergence speed outperforming [1], we obtain the first accelerated AND stochastic method outperforming [3]. In the NNZ running-time regime, we outperform [3] without even using alternating minimization for certain parameter regimes.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["Princeton University"], "authors": ["Zeyuan Allen Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Zeyuan_Allen", "Yuanzhi Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Yuanzhi"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
