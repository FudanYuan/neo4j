Many approaches are proposed to generate summaries but seldom simultaneously consider evolutionary characteristics of news plus to traditional summary elements. Therefore, we present a novel framework for the web mining problem named Evolutionary Timeline Summarization (ETS). Given the massive collection of time-stamped web documents related to a general news query, ETS aims to return the evolution trajectory along the timeline, consisting of individual but correlated summaries of each date, emphasizing  relevance, coverage, coherence  and  cross-date diversity . ETS greatly facilitates fast news browsing and knowledge comprehension and hence is a necessity. We formally formulate the task as an optimization problem via iterative substitution from a set of sentences to a subset of sentences that satisfies the above requirements, balancing coherence/diversity measurement and local/global summary quality. The optimized substitution is iteratively conducted by incorporating several constraints until convergence. We develop experimental systems to evaluate on 6 instinctively different datasets which amount to 10251 documents. Performance comparisons between different system-generated timelines and manually created ones by human editors demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in terms of ROUGE metrics.", "citation": "Citations (157)", "departments": ["Peking University", "Peking University", "Illinois Institute of Technology", "Peking University", "Peking University"], "authors": ["Rui Yan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yan:Rui", "Xiaojun Wan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wan_0001:Xiaojun", "Jahna Otterbacher.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Otterbacher:Jahna", "Liang Kong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kong:Liang", "Xiaoming Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Xiaoming", "Yan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0004:Yan"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
