We consider the scenario in which the scheduler does not have full knowledge of the channel state information, but instead estimates the channel state information by exploiting the memory inherent in the Markov channels along with ARQ-styled feedback from the scheduled users. Opportunistic scheduling is optimized in two stages: (1) Channel estimation and rate adaptation to maximize the expected immediate rate of the scheduled user; (2) User scheduling, based on the optimized immediate rate, to maximize the overall long term sum-throughput of the downlink. The scheduling problem is a partially observable Markov decision process with the classic \u2018exploitation vs exploration\u2019 trade-off that is difficult to quantify. We therefore study the problem in the framework of Restless Multi-armed Bandit Processes (RMBP) and perform a Whittle's indexability analysis. Whittle's indexability is traditionally known to be hard to establish and the index policy derived based on Whittle's indexability is known to have optimality properties in various settings. We show that the problem of downlink scheduling under imperfect channel state information is Whittle indexable and derive the Whittle's index policy in closed form. Via extensive numerical experiments, we show that the index policy has near-optimal performance. Our work reveals that, under incomplete channel state information, exploiting channel memory for opportunistic scheduling can result in significant performance gains and that almost all of these gains can be realized using an easy-to-implement index policy.", "citation": "Citations (24)", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Arizona State University", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University"], "authors": ["Wenzhuo Ouyang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ouyang:Wenzhuo", "Sugumar Murugesan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murugesan:Sugumar", "Atilla Eryilmaz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Eryilmaz:Atilla", "Ness B.
