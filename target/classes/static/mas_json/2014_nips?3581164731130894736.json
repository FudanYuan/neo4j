{"title": "A Multiplicative Model for Learning Distributed Text-Based Attribute Representations.", "fields": ["multiplicative function", "natural language processing", "attribution", "document classification", "sentence"], "abstract": "In this paper we propose a general framework for learning distributed representations of attributes: characteristics of text whose representations can be jointly learned with word embeddings. Attributes can correspond to a wide variety of concepts, such as document indicators (to learn sentence vectors), language indicators (to learn distributed language representations), meta-data and side information (such as the age, gender and industry of a blogger) or representations of authors. We describe a third-order model where word context and attribute vectors interact multiplicatively to predict the next word in a sequence. This leads to the notion of conditional word similarity: how meanings of words change when conditioned on different attributes. We perform several experimental tasks including sentiment classification, cross-lingual document classification, and blog authorship attribution. We also qualitatively evaluate conditional word neighbours and attribute-conditioned text generation.", "citation": "Citations (35)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Canadian Institute for Advanced Research", "Canadian Institute for Advanced Research", "Canadian Institute for Advanced Research"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Ryan Kiros.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kiros:Ryan", "Richard S.
