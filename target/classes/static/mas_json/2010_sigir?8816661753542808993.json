A promising way to accelerate similarity search is semantic hashing which designs compact binary codes for a large number of documents so that semantically similar documents are mapped to similar codes (within a short Hamming distance). Although some recently proposed techniques are able to generate high-quality codes for documents known in advance, obtaining the codes for previously unseen documents remains to be a very challenging problem. In this paper, we emphasise this issue and propose a novel Self-Taught Hashing (STH) approach to semantic hashing: we first find the optimal  l -bit binary codes for all documents in the given corpus via unsupervised learning, and then train  l  classifiers via supervised learning to predict the  l -bit code for any query document unseen before. Our experiments on three real-world text datasets show that the proposed approach using binarised Laplacian Eigenmap (LapEig) and linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) outperforms state-of-the-art techniques significantly.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Birkbeck, University of London", "University College London", "Zhejiang University", "Birkbeck, University of London"], "authors": ["Dell Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Dell", "Jun Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang_0012:Jun", "Deng Cai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cai:Deng", "Jinsong Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Jinsong"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
