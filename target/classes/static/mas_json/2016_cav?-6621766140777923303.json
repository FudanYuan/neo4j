We present efficient methods for termination analysis of nondeterministic probabilistic programs with polynomial guards and assignments. Our approach is through synthesis of polynomial ranking supermartingales, that on one hand significantly generalizes linear ranking supermartingales and on the other hand is a counterpart of polynomial ranking-functions for proving termination of nonprobabilistic programs. The approach synthesizes polynomial ranking-supermartingales through Positivstellensatz\u2019s, yielding an efficient method which is not only sound, but also semi-complete over a large subclass of programs. We show experimental results to demonstrate that our approach can handle several classical programs with complex polynomial guards and assignments, and can synthesize efficient quadratic ranking-supermartingales when a linear one does not exist even for simple affine programs.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "Institute of Science and Technology Austria"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Krishnendu Chatterjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chatterjee:Krishnendu", "Hongfei Fu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fu:Hongfei", "Amir Kafshdar Goharshady.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goharshady:Amir_Kafshdar"], "pages": 20}
