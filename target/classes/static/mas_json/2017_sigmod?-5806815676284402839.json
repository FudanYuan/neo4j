{"title": "Determining the Impact Regions of Competing Options in Preference Space.", "fields": ["targeted advertising", "market impact", "exploit", "weight", "orders of magnitude"], "abstract": "In rank-aware processing, user preferences are typically represented by a numeric weight per data attribute, collectively forming a  weight vector . The score of an option (data record) is defined as the weighted sum of its individual attributes. The highest-scoring options across a set of alternatives (dataset) are shortlisted for the user as the recommended ones. In that setting, the user input is a vector (equivalently, a point) in a  d -dimensional preference space, where  d  is the number of data attributes. In this paper we study the problem of determining in which regions of the preference space the weight vector should lie so that a given option ( focal record ) is among the top- k  score-wise. In effect, these regions capture all possible user profiles for which the focal record is highly preferable, and are therefore essential in market impact analysis, potential customer identification, profile-based marketing, targeted advertising, etc. We refer to our problem as  k-Shortlist Preference Region  identification ( k SPR), and exploit its computational geometric nature to develop a framework for its efficient (and exact) processing. Using real and synthetic benchmarks, we show that our most optimized algorithm outperforms by three orders of magnitude a competitor we constructed from previous work on a different problem.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "Singapore Management University", "Hong Kong Polytechnic University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Bo Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Bo", "Kyriakos Mouratidis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mouratidis:Kyriakos", "Man Lung Yiu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yiu:Man_Lung"], "pages": 16}
