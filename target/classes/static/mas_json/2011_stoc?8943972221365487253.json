It is a major open problem to design a deterministic polynomial time blackbox algorithm that tests if C is identically zero. Klivans & Spielman (STOC 2001) observed that the problem is open even when k is a constant. This case has been subjected to a serious study over the past few years, starting from the work of Dvir & Shpilka (STOC 2005).   We give the first polynomial time blackbox algorithm for this problem. Our algorithm runs in time poly(n)d k , regardless of the base field. The  only  field for which polynomial time algorithms were previously known is FF = QQ (Kayal & Saraf, FOCS 2009, and Saxena & Seshadhri, FOCS 2010). This is the first blackbox algorithm for depth-$3$ circuits that does not use the rank based approaches of Karnin & Shpilka (CCC 2008).   We prove an important tool for the study of depth-3 identities. We design a blackbox polynomial time transformation that reduces the number of variables in a \u03a3\u03a0\u03a3(k,d,n) circuit to k variables, but preserves the identity structure.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["Sandia National Laboratories", "Hausdorff Cente ... , Bonn, Germany"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Nitin Saxena.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Saxena_0001:Nitin", "C.
