We can build a prediction model with defect data collected from a software project and predict defects in the same project, i.e. within-project defect prediction (WPDP). Researchers also proposed cross-project defect prediction (CPDP) to predict defects for new projects lacking in defect data by using prediction models built by other projects. In recent studies, CPDP is proved to be feasible. However, CPDP requires projects that have the same metric set, meaning the metric sets should be identical between projects. As a result, current techniques for CPDP are difficult to apply across projects with heterogeneous metric sets. To address the limitation, we propose heterogeneous defect prediction (HDP) to predict defects across projects with heterogeneous metric sets. Our HDP approach conducts metric selection and metric matching to build a prediction model between projects with heterogeneous metric sets. Our empirical study on 28 subjects shows that about 68% of predictions using our approach outperform or are comparable to WPDP with statistical significance.", "citation": "Citations (98)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Handong Global University", "North Carolina State University", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "North Carolina State University", "University of Waterloo"], "authors": ["Jaechang Nam.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nam:Jaechang", "Sunghun Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim_0001:Sunghun"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
