{"title": "Buffer k-d Trees: Processing Massive Nearest Neighbor Queries on GPUs.", "fields": ["ball tree", "cover tree", "k d tree", "best bin first", "nearest neighbor search"], "abstract": "We present a new approach for combining k-d trees and graphics processing units for nearest neighbor search. It is well known that a direct combination of these tools leads to a nonsatisfying performance due to conditional computations and suboptimal memory accesses. To alleviate these problems, we propose a variant of the classical k-d tree data structure, called buffer k-d tree, which can be used to reorganize the search. Our experiments show that we can take advantage of both the hierarchical subdivision induced by k-d trees and the huge computational resources provided by today's many-core devices. We demonstrate the potential of our approach in astronomy, where hundreds of million nearest neighbor queries have to be processed.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Copenhagen", "University of Oldenburg", "University of Copenhagen", "University of Copenhagen"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Fabian Gieseke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gieseke:Fabian", "Justin Heinermann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Heinermann:Justin", "Cosmin E.
