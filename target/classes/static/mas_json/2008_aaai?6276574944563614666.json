Like many other real-world applications, this complex domain requires high-speed autonomous decision-making and robust continual operation. To our knowledge, this work represents the first successful industrial application of embedded domain-independent temporal planning. Our system handles execution failures and multi-objective preferences. At its heart is an on-line algorithm that combines techniques from state-space planning and partial-order scheduling. We suggest that this general architecture may prove useful in other applications as more intelligent systems operate in continual, on-line settings. Our system has been used to drive several commercial prototypes and has enabled a new product architecture for our industrial partner. When compared with state-of-the-art off-line planners, our system is hundreds of times faster and often finds better plans. Our experience demonstrates that domain-independent AI planning based on heuristic search can flexibly handle time, resources, replanning, and multiple objectives in a high-speed practical application without requiring hand-coded control knowledge.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "departments": ["University of New Hampshire", "PARC", "PARC", "PARC"], "authors": ["Minh Binh Do.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Do:Minh_Binh", "Wheeler Ruml.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruml:Wheeler", "Rong Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou_0001:Rong"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2008", "pages": 5}
