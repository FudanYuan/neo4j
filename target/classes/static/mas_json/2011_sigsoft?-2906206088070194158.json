{"title": "EvoSuite: automatic test suite generation for object-oriented software.", "fields": ["test case", "test suite", "object oriented programming", "correctness", "java"], "abstract": "To find defects in software, one needs test cases that execute the software systematically, and oracles that assess the correctness of the observed behavior when running these test cases. This paper presents EvoSuite, a tool that automatically generates test cases with assertions for classes written in Java code. To achieve this, EvoSuite applies a novel hybrid approach that generates and optimizes whole test suites towards satisfying a coverage criterion. For the produced test suites, EvoSuite suggests possible oracles by adding small and effective sets of assertions that concisely summarize the current behavior; these assertions allow the developer to detect deviations from expected behavior, and to capture the current behavior in order to protect against future defects breaking this behavior.", "citation": "Citations (434)", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Simula Research Laboratory"], "authors": ["Gordon Fraser.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fraser:Gordon", "Andrea Arcuri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arcuri:Andrea"], "conf": "sigsoft", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
