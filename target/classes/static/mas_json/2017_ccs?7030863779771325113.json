{"title": "A Type System for Privacy Properties.", "fields": ["helios", "bounded function", "equivalence", "ballot", "secrecy"], "abstract": "Mature push button tools have emerged for checking trace properties (e.g. secrecy or authentication) of security protocols. The case of indistinguishability-based privacy properties (e.g. ballot privacy or anonymity) is more complex and constitutes an active research topic with several recent propositions of techniques and tools.   We explore a novel approach based on type systems and provide a (sound) type system for proving equivalence of protocols, for a bounded or an unbounded number of sessions. The resulting prototype implementation has been tested on various protocols of the literature. It provides a significant speed-up (by orders of magnitude) compared to tools for a bounded number of sessions and complements in terms of expressiveness other state-of-the-art tools, such as ProVerif and Tamarin: e.g., we show that our analysis technique is the first one to handle a faithful encoding of the Helios e-voting protocol in the context of an untrusted ballot box.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Vienna University of Technology", "French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation", "Vienna University of Technology"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["V\u00e9ronique Cortier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cortier:V=eacute=ronique", "Niklas Grimm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Grimm:Niklas", "Joseph Lallemand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lallemand:Joseph", "Matteo Maffei.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Maffei:Matteo"], "pages": 15}
