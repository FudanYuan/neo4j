{"title": "Reuse It Or Lose It: More Efficient Secure Computation Through Reuse of Encrypted Values.", "fields": ["secure two party computation", "stateful firewall", "secure multi party computation", "reuse", "divide and choose"], "abstract": "Two-party secure-function evaluation (SFE) has become significantly more feasible, even on resource-constrained devices, because of advances in server-aided computation systems. However, there are still bottlenecks, particularly in the input-validation stage of a computation. Moreover, SFE research has not yet devoted sufficient attention to the important problem of retaining state after a computation has been performed so that expensive processing does not have to be repeated if a similar computation is done again. This paper presents PartialGC, an SFE system that allows the reuse of encrypted values generated during a garbled-circuit computation. We show that using PartialGC can reduce computation time by as much as 96% and bandwidth by as much as 98% in comparison with previous outsourcing schemes for secure computation. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach with two sets of experiments, one in which the garbled circuit is evaluated on a mobile device and one in which it is evaluated on a server. We also use PartialGC to build a privacy-preserving ``friend-finder'' application for Android. The reuse of previous inputs to allow stateful evaluation represents a new way of looking at SFE and further reduces computational barriers.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Florida", "Yale University", "University of Florida", "Yale University"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Benjamin Mood.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mood:Benjamin", "Debayan Gupta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gupta:Debayan", "Kevin R.
