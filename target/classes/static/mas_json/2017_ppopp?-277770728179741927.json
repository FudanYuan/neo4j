{"title": "Synchronized-by-Default Concurrency for Shared-Memory Systems.", "fields": ["software transactional memory", "concurrent object oriented programming", "optimistic concurrency control", "dacapo", "multiversion concurrency control"], "abstract": "We explore a programming approach for concurrency that synchronizes all accesses to shared memory by default. Synchronization takes place by ensuring that all program code runs inside atomic sections even if the program code has external side effects. Threads are mapped to atomic sections that a programmer must explicitly split to increase concurrency.   A naive implementation of this approach incurs a large amount of overhead. We show how to reduce this overhead to make the approach suitable for realistic application programs on existing hardware. We present an implementation technique based on a special-purpose software transactional memory system. To reduce the overhead, the technique exploits properties of managed, object-oriented programming languages as well as intraprocedural static analyses and uses field-level granularity locking in combination with transactional I/O to provide good scaling properties.   We implemented the synchronized-by-default (SBD) approach for the Java language and evaluate its performance for six programs from the DaCapo benchmark suite. The evaluation shows that, compared to explicit synchronization, the SBD approach has an overhead between 0.4% and 102% depending on the benchmark and the number of threads, with a mean (geom.) of 23.9%.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Martin B\u00e4ttig.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/B=auml=ttig:Martin", "Thomas R.
