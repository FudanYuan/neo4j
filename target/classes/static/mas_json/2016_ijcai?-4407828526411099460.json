{"title": "Predicting Personal Traits from Facial Images Using Convolutional Neural Networks Augmented with Facial Landmark Information.", "fields": ["pattern recognition", "channel", "convolutional neural network", "machine learning", "architecture", "artificial intelligence"], "abstract": "We consider the task of predicting various traits of a person given an image of their face. We estimate both objective traits, such as gender, ethnicity and hair-color; as well as subjective traits, such as the emotion a person expresses or whether he is humorous or attractive. For sizeable experimentation, we contribute a new Face Attributes Dataset (FAD), having roughly 200,000 attribute labels for the above traits, for over 10,000 facial images.\n\nDue to the recent surge of research on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we begin by using a CNN architecture for estimating facial attributes and show that they indeed provide an impressive baseline performance. To further improve performance, we propose a novel approach that incorporates facial landmark information for input images as an additional channel, helping the CNN learn better attribute-specific features so that the landmarks across various training images hold correspondence. We empirically analyse the performance of our method, showing consistent improvement over the baseline across traits.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Microsoft", "University of Cambridge", "Microsoft", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "Microsoft", "University of Cambridge", "Microsoft"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Yoad Lewenberg.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lewenberg:Yoad", "Yoram Bachrach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bachrach:Yoram", "Sukrit Shankar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shankar:Sukrit", "Antonio Criminisi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Criminisi:Antonio"], "pages": 7}
