This mechanism is particularly effective in private value environments where the distribution of valuations are irregular. Bidders can \"buy-it-now\", or alternatively \"take-a-chance\" where the top  d  bidders are equally likely to win. The randomized take-a-chance allocation incentivizes high valuation bidders to buy-it-now. We show that for a large class of valuations, this mechanism achieves similar allocations and revenues as Myerson's optimal mechanism, and outperforms the second-price auction with reserve.   In addition, we present an evaluation of bid data from Microsoft's AdECN platform. We find the valuations are irregular, and counterfactual experiments suggest our BIN-TAC mechanism would improve revenue by 11% relative to an optimal second-price mechanism with reserve.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of Washington", "Harvard University", "Harvard University", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["L.
