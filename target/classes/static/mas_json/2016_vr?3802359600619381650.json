As current AR displays only support relatively small fields of view, most AR applications to-date employ relatively small point-based annotations of the physical world. Anticipating a change in AR capabilities, we experiment with wide-field-of-view annotations that link elements far apart in the visual field. We have built a system that uses full-surround virtual reality to simulate augmented reality with different field of views, with and without tracking artifacts. We conducted a study comparing user performance on five different task groups within an information-seeking scenario, comparing two different fields of view and presence and absence of tracking artifacts. A constrained field of view significantly increased task completion time. We found indications for task time effects of tracking artifacts to vary depending on age.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara", "University of California, Santa Barbara"], "authors": ["Donghao Ren.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ren:Donghao", "Tibor Goldschwendt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goldschwendt:Tibor", "YunSuk Chang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chang:YunSuk", "Tobias H\u00f6llerer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/H=ouml=llerer:Tobias"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
