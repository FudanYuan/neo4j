Sparse spectrum alternatives attempt to answer this but are known to over-fit. We suggest the use of variational inference for the sparse spectrum approximation to avoid both issues. We model the covariance function with a finite Fourier series approximation and treat it as a random variable. The random covariance function has a posterior, on which a variational distribution is placed. The variational distribution transforms the random covariance function to fit the data. We study the properties of our approximate inference, compare it to alternative ones, and extend it to the distributed and stochastic domains. Our approximation captures complex functions better than standard approaches and avoids over-fitting.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Cambridge"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Yarin Gal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gal:Yarin", "Richard Turner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Turner:Richard"], "pages": 10}
