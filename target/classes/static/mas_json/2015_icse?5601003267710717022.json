One important factor is that malicious apps  treat sensitive data differently from benign apps.  To capture such differences, we mined 2,866 benign Android applications for their data flow from sensitive sources, and compare these flows against those found in malicious apps. We find that (a) for every sensitive source, the data ends up in a small number of typical sinks; (b) these sinks differ considerably between benign and malicious apps; (c) these differences can be used to flag malicious apps due to their abnormal data flow; and (d) malicious apps can be identified by their abnormal data flow alone, without requiring known malware samples. In our evaluation, our  mudflow  prototype correctly identified 86.4% of all novel malware, and 90.1% of novel malware leaking sensitive data.", "citation": "Citations (122)", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University", "IMDEA", "Saarland University", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "authors": ["Vitalii Avdiienko.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Avdiienko:Vitalii", "Konstantin Kuznetsov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuznetsov:Konstantin", "Alessandra Gorla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gorla:Alessandra", "Andreas Zeller.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeller:Andreas", "Steven Arzt.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arzt:Steven", "Siegfried Rasthofer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rasthofer:Siegfried", "Eric Bodden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bodden:Eric"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2015", "pages": 11}
