This is in contrast to most of the previous studies on multiple kernel learning that mainly focus on developing efficient algorithms and assume perfectly labeled training examples. Directly applying the existing multiple kernel learning algorithms to noisily labeled examples often leads to suboptimal performance due to the incorrect class assignments. We address this challenge by casting multiple kernel learning from noisy labels into a stochastic programming problem, and presenting a minimax formulation. We develop an efficient algorithm for solving the related convex-concave optimization problem with a fast convergence rate of O(1/T) where T is the number of iterations. Empirical studies on UCI data sets verify both the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Michigan State University", "Michigan State University", "Michigan State University", "Zhejiang University", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Tianbao Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang:Tianbao", "Mehrdad Mahdavi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mahdavi:Mehrdad", "Rong Jin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jin:Rong", "Lijun Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0005:Lijun", "Yang Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Yang"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
