{"title": "Using Graphs of Classifiers to Impose Declarative Constraints on Semi-supervised Learning.", "fields": ["declarative programming", "heuristics", "bayesian optimization", "semi supervised learning", "relationship extraction"], "abstract": "We propose a general approach to modeling semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms. Specifically, we present a declarative language for modeling both traditional supervised classification tasks and many SSL heuristics, including both well-known heuristics such as co-training and novel domain-specific heuristics. In addition to representing individual SSL heuristics, we show that multiple heuristics can be automatically combined using Bayesian optimization methods. We experiment with two classes of tasks, link-based text classification and relation extraction. We show modest improvements on well-studied link-based classification benchmarks, and state-of-the-art results on relation-extraction tasks for two realistic domains.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Tencent", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Lidong Bing.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bing:Lidong", "William W.
