{"title": "UnFlow: Unsupervised Learning of Optical Flow With a Bidirectional Census Loss.", "fields": ["optical flow", "deep learning", "training set", "labeled data", "scenario testing"], "abstract": "In the era of end-to-end deep learning, many advances in computer vision are driven by large amounts of labeled data. In the optical flow setting, however, obtaining dense per-pixel ground truth for real scenes is difficult and thus such data is rare. Therefore, recent end-to-end convolutional networks for optical flow rely on synthetic datasets for supervision, but the domain mismatch between training and test scenarios continues to be a challenge. Inspired by classical energy-based optical flow methods, we design an unsupervised loss based on occlusion-aware bidirectional flow estimation and the robust census transform to circumvent the need for ground truth flow. On the KITTI benchmarks, our unsupervised approach outperforms previous unsupervised deep networks by a large margin, and is even more accurate than similar supervised methods trained on synthetic datasets alone. By optionally fine-tuning on the KITTI training data, our method achieves competitive optical flow accuracy on the KITTI 2012 and 2015 benchmarks, thus in addition enabling generic pre-training of supervised networks for datasets with limited amounts of ground truth.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "authors": ["Simon Meister.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Meister:Simon", "Junhwa Hur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hur:Junhwa", "Stefan Roth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Roth_0001:Stefan"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
