{"title": "Can Quadrotors Succeed as an Educational Platform?", "fields": ["simulation", "embodied cognition", "robotics", "controllability", "popularity"], "abstract": "The flexibility and controllability of quadrotor helicopters have made them a recent focus of interest among robotics and AI research groups. At the same time, their popularity has led to a wide range of commercially available platforms, some at prices accessible for undergraduate educational use. This project evaluates the ARDrone quadrotor helicopter as a basis for use in undergraduate classes such as robotics, computer vision, or embodied AI. We have encountered both successes and frustrations in using the ARDrone to date. Looking forward, the quadrotor's capabilities do seem a promising basis for future curricular offerings.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Harvey Mudd College"], "authors": ["Zachary Dodds.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dodds:Zachary"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2011", "pages": -1}
