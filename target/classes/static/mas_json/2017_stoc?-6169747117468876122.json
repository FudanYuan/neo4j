{"title": "Strongly refuting random CSPs below the spectral threshold.", "fields": ["logarithm", "integer", "constraint satisfaction problem", "combinatorics", "satisfiability"], "abstract": "Random constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) are known to exhibit threshold phenomena: given a uniformly random instance of a CSP with  n  variables and  m  clauses, there is a value of  m  = I\u00a9( n ) beyond which the CSP will be unsatisfiable with high probability. Strong refutation is the problem of certifying that no variable assignment satisfies more than a constant fraction of clauses; this is the natural algorithmic problem in the unsatisfiable regime (when  m / n  = \ufffd (1)).   Intuitively, strong refutation should become easier as the clause density  m / n  grows, because the contradictions introduced by the random clauses become more locally apparent. For CSPs such as  k -SAT and  k -XOR, there is a long-standing gap between the clause density at which efficient strong refutation algorithms are known,  m / n  \u00e2 \ufffd \ufffd ( n   k /2\u00e2  1 ), and the clause density at which instances become unsatisfiable with high probability,  m / n  = \ufffd  (1).   In this paper, we give spectral and sum-of-squares algorithms for strongly refuting random  k -XOR instances with clause density  m / n  \u00e2 \ufffd \ufffd ( n  ( k /2\u00e2  1)(1\u00e2  I\ufffd) ) in time exp(\ufffd ( n  I\ufffd )) or in \ufffd ( n  I\ufffd ) rounds of the sum-of-squares hierarchy, for any I\ufffd \u00e2   [0,1) and any integer  k  \u00e2 \ufffd 3. Our algorithms provide a smooth transition between the clause density at which polynomial-time algorithms are known at I\ufffd = 0, and brute-force refutation at the satisfiability threshold when I\ufffd = 1. We also leverage our  k -XOR results to obtain strong refutation algorithms for SAT (or any other Boolean CSP) at similar clause densities.   Our algorithms match the known sum-of-squares lower bounds due to Grigoriev and Schonebeck, up to logarithmic factors.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["Prasad Raghavendra.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raghavendra:Prasad", "Satish Rao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rao:Satish", "Tselil Schramm.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schramm:Tselil"], "pages": 11}
