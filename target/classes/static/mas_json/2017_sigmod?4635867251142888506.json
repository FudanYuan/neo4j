{"title": "A Cost-based Optimizer for Gradient Descent Optimization.", "fields": ["operator", "gradient descent", "optimization problem", "big data", "machine learning"], "abstract": "As the use of machine learning (ML) permeates into diverse application domains, there is an urgent need to support a declarative framework for ML. Ideally, a user will specify an ML task in a high-level and easy-to-use language and the framework will invoke the appropriate algorithms and system configurations to execute it. An important observation towards designing such a framework is that many ML tasks can be expressed as mathematical optimization problems, which take a specific form. Furthermore, these optimization problems can be efficiently solved using variations of the gradient descent (GD) algorithm. Thus, to decouple a user specification of an ML task from its execution, a key component is a GD optimizer. We propose a cost-based GD optimizer that selects the best GD plan for a given ML task. To build our optimizer, we introduce a set of abstract operators for expressing GD algorithms and propose a novel approach to estimate the number of iterations a GD algorithm requires to converge. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets show that our optimizer not only chooses the best GD plan but also allows for optimizations that achieve orders of magnitude performance speed-up.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Qatar Airways", "Qatar Airways", "Qatar Airways", "Qatar Airways", "University of California, Santa Barbara"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Zoi Kaoudi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kaoudi:Zoi", "Jorge-Arnulfo Quian\u00e9-Ruiz.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Quian=eacute==Ruiz:Jorge=Arnulfo", "Saravanan Thirumuruganathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Thirumuruganathan:Saravanan", "Sanjay Chawla.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chawla:Sanjay", "Divy Agrawal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agrawal:Divy"], "pages": 16}
