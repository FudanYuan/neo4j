{"title": "Probabilistic FastText for Multi-Sense Word Embeddings.", "fields": ["word sense", "foreign language", "probabilistic logic", "gaussian", "mixture distribution"], "abstract": "We introduce Probabilistic FastText, a new model for word embeddings that can capture multiple word senses, sub-word structure, and uncertainty information. In particular, we represent each word with a Gaussian mixture density, where the mean of a mixture component is given by the sum of n-grams. This representation allows the model to share statistical strength across sub-word structures (e.g. Latin roots), producing accurate representations of rare, misspelt, or even unseen words. Moreover, each component of the mixture can capture a different word sense. Probabilistic FastText outperforms both FastText, which has no probabilistic model, and dictionary-level probabilistic embeddings, which do not incorporate subword structures, on several word-similarity benchmarks, including English RareWord and foreign language datasets. We also achieve state-of-art performance on benchmarks that measure ability to discern different meanings. Thus, the proposed model is the first to achieve multi-sense representations while having enriched semantics on rare words.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Lancaster University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Ben Athiwaratkun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Athiwaratkun:Ben", "Andrew Gordon Wilson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wilson:Andrew_Gordon", "Anima Anandkumar.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Anandkumar:Anima"], "pages": 11}
