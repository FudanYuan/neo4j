{"title": "Scalable k-NN graph construction for visual descriptors.", "fields": ["graph bandwidth", "graph", "modular decomposition", "null graph", "clique width"], "abstract": "The k-NN graph has played a central role in increasingly popular data-driven techniques for various learning and vision tasks; yet, finding an efficient and effective way to construct k-NN graphs remains a challenge, especially for large-scale high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose a new approach to construct approximate k-NN graphs with emphasis in: efficiency and accuracy. We hierarchically and randomly divide the data points into subsets and build an exact neighborhood graph over each subset, achieving a base approximate neighborhood graph; we then repeat this process for several times to generate multiple neighborhood graphs, which are combined to yield a more accurate approximate neighborhood graph. Furthermore, we propose a neighborhood propagation scheme to further enhance the accuracy. We show both theoretical and empirical accuracy and efficiency of our approach to k-NN graph construction and demonstrate significant speed-up in dealing with large scale visual data.", "citation": "Citations (85)", "year": "2012", "departments": ["Peking University", "Microsoft", "Peking University", "Microsoft", "Peking University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jing Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jing", "Jingdong Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Jingdong", "Gang Zeng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zeng:Gang", "Zhuowen Tu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tu:Zhuowen", "Rui Gan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gan:Rui", "Shipeng Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Shipeng"], "pages": 8}
