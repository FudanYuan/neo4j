{"title": "Do code clones matter?", "fields": ["duplicate code", "software maintenance", "correctness", "software fault tolerance", "public domain software"], "abstract": "Code cloning is not only assumed to inflate maintenance costs but also considered defect-prone as inconsistent changes to code duplicates can lead to unexpected behavior. Consequently, the identification of duplicated code, clone detection, has been a very active area of research in recent years. Up to now, however, no substantial investigation of the consequences of code cloning on program correctness has been carried out. To remedy this shortcoming, this paper presents the results of a large-scale case study that was undertaken to find out if inconsistent changes to cloned code can indicate faults. For the analyzed commercial and open source systems we not only found that inconsistent changes to clones are very frequent but also identified a significant number of faults induced by such changes. The clone detection tool used in the case study implements a novel algorithm for the detection of inconsistent clones. It is available as open source to enable other researchers to use it as basis for further investigations.", "citation": "Citations (425)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "authors": ["Elmar J\u00fcrgens.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/J=uuml=rgens:Elmar", "Florian Deissenboeck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deissenboeck:Florian", "Benjamin Hummel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hummel:Benjamin", "Stefan Wagner.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wagner_0001:Stefan"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2009", "pages": 11}
