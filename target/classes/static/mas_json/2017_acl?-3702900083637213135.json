This feedback is received in the form of a task loss evaluation to a predicted output structure, without having access to gold standard structures. We advance this framework by lifting linear bandit learning to neural sequence-to-sequence learning problems using attention-based recurrent neural networks. Furthermore, we show how to incorporate control variates into our learning algorithms for variance reduction and improved generalization. We present an evaluation on a neural machine translation task that shows improvements of up to 5.89 BLEU points for domain adaptation from simulated bandit feedback.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Heidelberg University", "University of Colorado Denver", "Heidelberg University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Julia Kreutzer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kreutzer:Julia", "Artem Sokolov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sokolov:Artem", "Stefan Riezler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Riezler:Stefan"], "pages": 11}
