Existing meshing algorithms were proposed with the assumption that computer memory is  volatile.  Consequently, for failure recovery, the in-core algorithms need to save memory states as snapshots with slow file I/Os. The out-of-core algorithms store octants on disks for persistence. However, neither of them was designed to leverage unique characteristics of non-volatile byte-addressable memory (NVBM). In this paper, we propose a novel data structure Persistent Merged octree (PM-octree) for both meshing and in-memory storage of persistent octrees using NVBM. It is a multi-version data structure and can recover from failures using its earlier persistent version stored in NVBM. In addition, we design a feature-directed sampling approach to help dynamically transform the PM-octree layout for reducing NVBM-induced memory write latency. PM-octree has been successfully integrated with Gerris software for simulation of fluid dynamics. Our experimental results with real-world scientific workloads show that PM-octree scales up to 1.1 billion mesh elements with 1000 processors on the Titan supercomputer.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Washington State University", "Washington State University", "Washington State University"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Bao Nguyen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nguyen:Bao", "Hua Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Hua", "Xuechen Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Xuechen"], "pages": 12}
