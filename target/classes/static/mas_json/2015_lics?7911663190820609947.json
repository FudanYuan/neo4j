In the context of categorical quantum mechanics, Coecke and Kissinger suggested that two 3-qubit states, GHZ and W, may be used as the building blocks of a new graphical calculus, aimed at a diagrammatic classification of multipartite qubit entanglement that would highlight the communicational properties of quantum states, and their potential uses in cryptographic schemes. In this paper, we present a full graphical axiomatisation of the relations between GHZ and W: the ZW calculus. This refines a version of the preexisting ZX calculus, while keeping its most desirable characteristics: undirected ness, a large degree of symmetry, and an algebraic underpinning. We prove that the ZW calculus is complete for the category of free abelian groups on a power of two generators -- \"qubits with integer coefficients\" -- and provide an explicit normalisation procedure.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Amar Hadzihasanovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hadzihasanovic:Amar"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
