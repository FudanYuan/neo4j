The goal of meta-learning is to train a model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it can solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples. In our approach, the parameters of the model are explicitly trained such that a small number of gradient steps with a small amount of training data from a new task will produce good generalization performance on that task. In effect, our method trains the model to be easy to fine-tune. We demonstrate that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on two few-shot image classification benchmarks, produces good results on few-shot regression, and accelerates fine-tuning for policy gradient reinforcement learning with neural network policies.", "citation": "Citations (217)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Chelsea Finn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Finn:Chelsea", "Pieter Abbeel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Abbeel:Pieter", "Sergey Levine.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Levine:Sergey"], "pages": 10}
