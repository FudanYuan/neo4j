To overcome the limitations of scale in existing works, our proposed algorithms allow every mobile sensing agent to choose a different support set and dynamically switch to another during execution for encapsulating its own data into a local summary that, perhaps surprisingly, can still be assimilated with the other agents' local summaries (i.e., based on their current choices of support sets) into a globally consistent summary to be used for predicting the phenomenon. To achieve this, we propose a novel transfer learning mechanism for a team of agents capable of sharing and transferring information encapsulated in a summary based on a support set to that utilizing a different support set with some loss that can be theoretically bounded and analyzed. To alleviate the issue of information loss accumulating over multiple instances of transfer learning, we propose a new information sharing mechanism to be incorporated into our algorithms in order to achieve memory-efficient lazy transfer learning. Empirical evaluation on real-world datasets show that our algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art methods.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": [], "authors": ["Ruofei Ouyang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Ouyang:Ruofei", "Kian Hsiang Low.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Low:Kian_Hsiang"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
