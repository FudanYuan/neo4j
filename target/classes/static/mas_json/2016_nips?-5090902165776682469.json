{"title": "Learning a Probabilistic Latent Space of Object Shapes via 3D Generative-Adversarial Modeling.", "fields": ["object oriented design", "generative grammar", "discriminator", "heuristic", "adversarial system"], "abstract": "We study the problem of 3D object generation. We propose a novel framework, namely 3D Generative Adversarial Network (3D-GAN), which generates 3D objects from a probabilistic space by leveraging recent advances in volumetric convolutional networks and generative adversarial nets. The benefits of our model are three-fold: first, the use of an adversarial criterion, instead of traditional heuristic criteria, enables the generator to capture object structure implicitly and to synthesize high-quality 3D objects; second, the generator establishes a mapping from a low-dimensional probabilistic space to the space of 3D objects, so that we can sample objects without a reference image or CAD models, and explore the 3D object manifold; third, the adversarial discriminator provides a powerful 3D shape descriptor which, learned without supervision, has wide applications in 3D object recognition. Experiments demonstrate that our method generates high-quality 3D objects, and our unsupervisedly learned features achieve impressive performance on 3D object recognition, comparable with those of supervised learning methods.", "citation": "Citations (267)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Jiajun Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu_0001:Jiajun", "Chengkai Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Chengkai", "Tianfan Xue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xue:Tianfan", "Bill Freeman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Freeman:Bill", "Josh Tenenbaum.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tenenbaum:Josh"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
