{"title": "A space efficient streaming algorithm for triangle counting using the birthday paradox.", "fields": ["strength of a graph", "pseudoforest", "hypercube graph", "hopcroft karp algorithm", "multiple edges"], "abstract": "We design a space efficient algorithm that approximates the transitivity (global clustering coefficient) and total triangle count with only a single pass through a graph given as a stream of edges. Our procedure is based on the classic probabilistic result,  the birthday paradox . When the transitivity is constant and there are more edges than wedges (common properties for social networks), we can prove that our algorithm requires  O (\u221a n ) space ( n  is the number of vertices) to provide accurate estimates. We run a detailed set of experiments on a variety of real graphs and demonstrate that the memory requirement of the algorithm is a tiny fraction of the graph. For example, even for a graph with 200 million edges, our algorithm stores just 60,000 edges to give accurate results. Being a single pass streaming algorithm, our procedure also maintains a real-time estimate of the transitivity/number of triangles of a graph, by storing a miniscule fraction of edges.", "citation": "Citations (87)", "departments": ["Pennsylvania State University", "Sandia National Laboratories", "Sandia National Laboratories"], "authors": ["Madhav Jha.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jha:Madhav", "C.
