Previous efforts in this direction have focused on traversing a kernel grammar, only examining the data via computation of marginal likelihood. Our proposed search method is based on Bayesian optimization in model space, where we reason about model evidence as a function to be maximized. We explicitly reason about the data distribution and how it induces similarity between potential model choices in terms of the explanations they can offer for observed data. In this light, we construct a novel kernel between models to explain a given dataset. Our method is capable of finding a model that explains a given dataset well without any human assistance, often with fewer computations of model evidence than previous approaches, a claim we demonstrate empirically.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Washington University in St. Louis", "Washington University in St. Louis", "Washington University in St. Louis", "Washington University in St. Louis"], "authors": ["Gustavo Malkomes.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Malkomes:Gustavo", "Chip Schaff.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schaff:Chip", "Roman Garnett.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Garnett:Roman"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
