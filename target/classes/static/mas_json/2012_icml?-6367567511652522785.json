Most of the state of the art focus on learning Mahalanobis distances (requiring to fulfill a constraint of positive semi-definiteness) for use in a local k-NN algorithm. However, no theoretical link is established between the learned metrics and their performance in classification. In this paper, we make use of the formal framework of (e, \u03b3, \u03c4)-good similarities introduced by Balcan et al. to design an algorithm for learning a non PSD linear similarity optimized in a nonlinear feature space, which is then used to build a global linear classifier. We show that our approach has uniform stability and derive a generalization bound on the classification error. Experiments performed on various datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods and provide evidence that (i) it is fast, (ii) robust to overfitting and (iii) produces very sparse classifiers.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique"], "authors": ["Aur\u00e9lien Bellet.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bellet:Aur=eacute=lien", "Amaury Habrard.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Habrard:Amaury", "Marc Sebban.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sebban:Marc"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
