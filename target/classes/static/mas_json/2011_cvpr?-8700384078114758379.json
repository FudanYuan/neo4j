It is shown that the solutions to the aforementioned problems all satisfy Sylvester Equations, which leads to substantial computational gains; specifically, the solution of the Sylvester Equation is direct (non-iterative) and for an m \u00d7 n surface is of the same complexity as computing an SVD of the same size, i.e., an O (n 3 ) algorithm. In contrast, state-of-the-art algorithms are based on large-scale-linear-solvers, and use iterative techniques based on an O [n6) linear sub-step. To emphasize this improvement, it is demonstrated that the new algorithms are upwards of 10 4  (ten-thousand) times faster than the state-of-the-art techniques incorporating regularization. In fact, the new algorithms allow for the realtime regularized reconstruction of surfaces on the order of megapixels, which is unprecedented for this computer vision problem.", "citation": "Citations (17)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of Leoben", "University of Leoben"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Matthew Harker.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Harker:Matthew", "Paul O'Leary.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/O=Leary:Paul"], "pages": 8}
