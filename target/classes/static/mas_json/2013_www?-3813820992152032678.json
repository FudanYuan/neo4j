In this paper, we capture OSP's personalization for an user in a new data structure called the  personalization vector  (?), which is a weighted vector over a set of  topics , and present efficient algorithms to learn it.   Our approach treats OSPs as black-boxes, and extracts \u03b7 by mining only their  output , specifically, the  personalized  (for an user) and  vanilla  (without any user information) contents served, and the differences in these content. We believe that such treatment of OSPs is a unique aspect of our work, not just enabling access to (so far hidden) profiles in OSPs, but also providing a novel and practical approach for retrieving information from OSPs by mining differences in their outputs.   We formulate a new model called Latent Topic Personalization (LTP) that captures the personalization vector in a learning framework and present efficient inference algorithms for determining it. We perform extensive experiments targeting search engine personalization, using data from both real Google users and synthetic setup. Our results indicate that LTP achieves high accuracy (R-pre = 84%) in discovering personalized topics.For Google data, our qualitative results demonstrate that the topics determined by LTP for a user correspond well to his ad-categories determined by Google.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["Bell Labs", "Bell Labs"], "authors": ["Anirban Majumder.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Majumder:Anirban", "Nisheeth Shrivastava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shrivastava:Nisheeth"], "conf": "www", "year": "2013", "pages": 12}
