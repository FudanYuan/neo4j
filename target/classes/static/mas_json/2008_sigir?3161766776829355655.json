{"title": "SpotSigs: robust and efficient near duplicate detection in large web collections.", "fields": ["locality sensitive hashing", "precision and recall", "nearest neighbor search", "exploit", "inverted index"], "abstract": "Motivated by our work with political scientists who need to manually analyze large Web archives of news sites, we present  SpotSigs , a new algorithm for extracting and matching signatures for near duplicate detection in large Web crawls. Our spot signatures are designed to favor natural-language portions of Web pages over advertisements and navigational bars.   The contributions of SpotSigs are twofold: 1) by combining stopword antecedents with short chains of adjacent content terms, we create robust document signatures with a natural ability to filter out noisy components of Web pages that would otherwise distract pure n-gram-based approaches such as Shingling; 2) we provide an  exact  and  efficient ,  self-tuning  matching algorithm that exploits a novel combination of collection partitioning and inverted index pruning for high-dimensional similarity search. Experiments confirm an increase in combined precision and recall of more than 24 percent over state-of-the-art approaches such as Shingling or I-Match and up to a factor of 3 faster execution times than Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), over a demonstrative \"Gold Set\" of manually assessed near-duplicate news articles as well as the TREC WT10g Web collection.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Max Planck Society"], "authors": ["Martin Theobald.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Theobald:Martin", "Jonathan Siddharth.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Siddharth:Jonathan", "Andreas Paepcke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Paepcke:Andreas"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2008", "pages": 8}
