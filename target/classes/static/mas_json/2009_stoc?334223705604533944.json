As a result we obtain a construction of O(1) log* n -round (i.e., \"essentially\" constant-round) non-malleable commitments from any one-way function, and using a black-box proof of security.", "citation": "Citations (34)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Huijia Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Huijia", "Rafael Pass.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pass:Rafael"], "conf": "stoc", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
