{"title": "Generalization of ERM in Stochastic Convex Optimization: The Dimension Strikes Back.", "fields": ["uniform convergence", "bounded function", "empirical risk minimization", "convex set", "regular polygon"], "abstract": "In stochastic convex optimization the goal is to minimize a convex function $F(x) \\doteq \\E_{f\\sim D}[f(x)]$ over a convex set $\\K \\subset \\R^d$ where $D$ is some unknown distribution and each $f(\\cdot)$ in the support of $D$ is convex over $\\K$. The optimization is based on i.i.d.~samples $f^1,f^2,\\ldots,f^n$ from $D$. A common approach to such problems is empirical risk minimization (ERM) that optimizes $F_S(x) \\doteq \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i\\leq n} f^i(x)$. Here we consider the question of how many samples are necessary for ERM to succeed and the closely related question of uniform convergence of $F_S$ to $F$ over $\\K$. We demonstrate that in the standard $\\ell_p/\\ell_q$ setting of Lipschitz-bounded functions over a $\\K$ of bounded radius, ERM requires sample size that scales linearly with the dimension $d$. This nearly matches standard upper bounds and improves on $\\Omega(\\log d)$ dependence proved for $\\ell_2/\\ell_2$ setting in (Shalev-Shwartz et al. 2009). In stark contrast, these problems can be solved using dimension-independent number of samples for $\\ell_2/\\ell_2$ setting and $\\log d$ dependence for $\\ell_1/\\ell_\\infty$ setting using other approaches. We also demonstrate that for a more general class of range-bounded (but not Lipschitz-bounded) stochastic convex programs an even stronger gap appears already in dimension 2.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["IBM"], "authors": ["Vitaly Feldman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Feldman:Vitaly"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
