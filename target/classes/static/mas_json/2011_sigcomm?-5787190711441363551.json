{"title": "Strider: automatic rate adaptation and collision handling.", "fields": ["network packet", "collision", "communication source", "gaussian", "channel capacity"], "abstract": "This paper presents the design, implementation and evaluation of Strider, a system that automatically achieves almost the optimal rate adaptation without incurring any overhead. The key component in Strider is a novel code that has two important properties: it is  rateless and collision-resilient . First, in time-varying wireless channels, Strider's rateless code allows a sender to effectively achieve almost the optimal bitrate, without knowing how the channel state varies. Second, Strider's collision-resilient code allows a receiver to decode both packets from collisions, and achieves the same throughput as the collision-free scheduler. We show via theoretical analysis that Strider achieves Shannon capacity for Gaussian channels, and our empirical evaluation shows that Strider outperforms SoftRate, a state of the art rate adaptation technique by 70% in mobile scenarios and by upto 2.8\u00d7 in contention scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (157)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Aditya Gudipati.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gudipati:Aditya", "Sachin Katti.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Katti:Sachin"], "conf": "sigcomm", "year": "2011", "pages": 12}
