In this work, we address the problem of inferring the polarity of relationships between people in narrative summaries. We formulate the problem as a joint structured prediction for each narrative, and present a general model that combines evidence from linguistic and semantic features, as well as features based on the structure of the social community in the text. We additionally provide a clustering-based approach that can exploit regularities in narrative types. e.g., learn an affinity for love-triangles in romantic stories. On a dataset of movie summaries from Wikipedia, our structured models provide more than a 30% error-reduction over a competitive baseline that considers pairs of characters in isolation.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Shashank Srivastava.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srivastava:Shashank", "Snigdha Chaturvedi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaturvedi:Snigdha", "Tom M.
