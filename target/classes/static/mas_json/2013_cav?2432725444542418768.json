For MDPs with treewidth k, we present two improved static algorithms for both the problems that run in time O(n \u00b7k2.38 \u00b72k) and O(m \u00b7logn \u00b7k), respectively, where n is the number of states and m is the number of edges, significantly improving the previous known $O(n\\cdot k \\cdot \\sqrt{n\\cdot k})$ bound for low treewidth. We also present decremental algorithms for both problems for MDPs with constant treewidth that run in amortized logarithmic time, which is a huge improvement over the previously known algorithms that require amortized linear time.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Institute of Science and Technology Austria", "University of Warsaw"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Krishnendu Chatterjee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chatterjee:Krishnendu", "Jakub Lacki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lacki:Jakub"], "pages": 16}
