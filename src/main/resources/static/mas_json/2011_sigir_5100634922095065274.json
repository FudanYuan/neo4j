In this paper, GPS data is used in location-based services (LBSs) to provide collaborative location recommendations. We observe that most existing LBSs provide location recommendations by clustering the User-Location matrix. Since the User-Location matrix created based on GPS data is huge, there are two major problems with these methods. First, the number of similar locations that need to be considered in computing the recommendations can be numerous. As a result, the identification of truly relevant locations from numerous candidates is challenging. Second, the clustering process on large matrix is time consuming. Thus, when new GPS data arrives, complete re-clustering of the whole matrix is infeasible. To tackle these two problems, we propose the Collaborative Location Recommendation (CLR) framework for location recommendation. By considering activities (i.e., temporal preferences) and different user classes (i.e., Pattern Users, Normal Users, and Travelers) in the recommendation process, CLR is capable of generating more precise and refined recommendations to the users compared to the existing methods. Moreover, CLR employs a dynamic clustering algorithm CADC to cluster the trajectory data into groups of similar users, similar activities and similar locations efficiently by supporting incremental update of the groups when new GPS trajectory data arrives. We evaluate CLR with a real-world GPS dataset, and confirm that the CLR framework provides more accurate location recommendations compared to the existing methods.", "citation": "Citations (127)", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Pennsylvania State University"], "authors": ["Kenneth Wai-Ting Leung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leung:Kenneth_Wai=Ting", "Dik Lun Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Dik_Lun", "Wang-Chien Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Wang=Chien"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2011", "pages": 10}
