We use a Gomory-Hu tree to represent all the pairwise min cuts implicitly. Previously, no subquadratic time algorithm was known for this problem. Since all-pairs min cut and the minimum-cycle basis are dual problems in planar graphs, we also obtain an implicit representation of a minimum-cycle basis in  O ( n  log 4   n ) time and  O ( n  log  n ) space. Additionally, an explicit representation can be obtained in  O ( C ) time and space where  C  is the size of the basis.   These results require that shortest paths are unique. This can be guaranteed either by using randomization without overhead or deterministically with an additional log 2   n  factor in the preprocessing times.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2010", "departments": ["Oregon State University", "University of Warsaw", "University of Copenhagen", "Oregon State University", "University of Warsaw", "University of Copenhagen"], "conf": "focs", "authors": ["Glencora Borradaile.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Borradaile:Glencora", "Piotr Sankowski.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sankowski:Piotr", "Christian Wulff-Nilsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wulff=Nilsen:Christian"], "pages": 10}
