By combining a novel data set containing the dynamics of millions of  ad hoc  teams from the popular multiplayer online first person shooter  Halo: Reach  with survey data on player demographics, play style, psychometrics and friendships derived from an anonymous online survey, we investigate the impact of friendship on collaborative and competitive performance. In addition to finding significant differences in player behavior across these variables, we find that friendships exert a strong influence, leading to both improved individual and team performance - even after controlling for the overall expertise of the team - and increased pro-social behaviors. Players also structure their in-game activities around social opportunities, and as a result hidden friendship ties can be accurately inferred directly from behavioral time series. Virtual environments that enable such friendship effects will thus likely see improved collaboration and competition.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "departments": ["Stevens Institute of Technology", "University of Colorado Boulder"], "authors": ["Winter A.
