We propose a new paradigm where such implants may communicate wirelessly through a technique called as galvanic coupling, which uses weak electrical signals and the conduction properties of body tissues. While galvanic coupling overcomes the problem of massive absorption of RF waves in the body, the unique intra-body channel raises several questions on the topology of the implants and the external (i.e., on skin) data collection nodes. This paper makes the first contributions towards (i) building an energy-efficient topology through optimal placement of data collection points/relays using measurement-driven tissue channel models, and (ii) balancing the energy consumption over the entire implant network so that the application needs are met. We achieve this via a two-phase iterative clustering algorithm for the implants and formulate an optimization problem that decides the position of external data-gathering points. Our theoretical results are validated via simulations and experimental studies on real tissues, with demonstrated increase in the network lifetime.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Northeastern University", "Northeastern University", "Northeastern University"], "authors": ["Meenupriya Swaminathan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Swaminathan:Meenupriya", "Ufuk Muncuk.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Muncuk:Ufuk", "Kaushik R.
