This direct approach shares the structural benefits of leading stereo matching pipelines, which are known to yield high accuracy. To this day, such approaches have been considered impractical due to the size of the cost volume. We show that the full four-dimensional cost volume can be constructed in a fraction of a second due to its regularity. We then exploit this regularity further by adapting semi-global matching to the four-dimensional setting. This yields a pipeline that achieves significantly higher accuracy than state-of-the-art optical flow methods while being faster than most. Our approach outperforms all published general-purpose optical flow methods on both Sintel and KITTI 2015 benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Tencent", "Graz University of Technology", "Intel"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Jia Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Jia", "Rene Ranftl.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ranftl:Rene", "Vladlen Koltun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koltun:Vladlen"], "pages": 9}
