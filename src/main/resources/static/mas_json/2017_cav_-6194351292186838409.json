We use timed regular expressions as a compact, natural, and highly-expressive pattern specification language for monitoring applications involving quantitative timing constraints. Our tool essentially incorporates online and offline timed pattern matching algorithms so it is capable of finding all occurrences of a given pattern over both logged and streaming behaviors. Furthermore, Montre is designed to work with other tools via standard interfaces to perform more complex and versatile tasks for analyzing and reasoning about cyber-physical systems. As the first of its kind, we believe Montre will enable a new line of inquiries and techniques in these fields.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Verimag, Univer ...
