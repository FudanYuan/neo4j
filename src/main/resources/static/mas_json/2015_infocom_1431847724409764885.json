We consider the online DSCP, in which the subsets arrive one by one (possibly in an order chosen by an adversary), and must be irrevocably assigned to some partition on arrival with the objective of minimizing the competitive ratio. The competitive ratio of an online DSCP algorithm A is defined as the maximum ratio of the number of disjoint set covers obtained by the optimal offline algorithm to the number of disjoint set covers obtained by A across all inputs. We propose an online algorithm for solving the DSCP with competitive ratio ln n. We then show a lower bound of \u2126(\u221aln n) on the competitive ratio for any online DSCP algorithm. The online disjoint set cover problem has wide ranging applications in practice, including the online crowd-sourcing problem, the online coverage lifetime maximization problem in WSNs, and in online resource allocation problems.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "Indian Institute of Technology Madras", "Tata Institute of Fundamental Research"], "authors": ["Ashwin Pananjady.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pananjady:Ashwin", "Vivek Kumar Bagaria.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bagaria:Vivek_Kumar", "Rahul Vaze.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vaze:Rahul"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
