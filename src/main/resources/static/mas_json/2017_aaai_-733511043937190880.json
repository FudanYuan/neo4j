However, most of these games take place in 2D environments that are fully observable to the agent. In this paper, we present the first architecture to tackle 3D environments in first-person shooter games, that involve partially observable states. Typically, deep reinforcement learning methods only utilize visual input for training. We present a method to augment these models to exploit game feature information such as the presence of enemies or items, during the training phase. Our model is trained to simultaneously learn these features along with minimizing a Q-learning objective, which is shown to dramatically improve the training speed and performance of our agent. Our architecture is also modularized to allow different models to be independently trained for different phases of the game. We show that the proposed architecture substantially outperforms built-in AI agents of the game as well as humans in deathmatch scenarios.", "citation": "Citations (123)", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University"], "authors": ["Guillaume Lample.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lample:Guillaume", "Devendra Singh Chaplot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaplot:Devendra_Singh"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2017", "pages": 7}
