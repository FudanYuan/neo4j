Today's network cards contain rather powerful processors optimized for data movement. However, these devices are limited to fixed functions, such as remote direct memory access. We develop sPIN, a portable programming model to offload simple packet processing functions to the network card. To demonstrate the potential of the model, we design a cycle-accurate simulation environment by combining the network simulator Log-GOPSim and the CPU simulator gem5. We implement offloaded message matching, datatype processing, and collective communications and demonstrate transparent full-application speedups. Furthermore, we show how sPIN can be used to accelerate redundant in-memory filesystems and several other use cases. Our work investigates a portable packet-processing network acceleration model similar to compute acceleration with CUDA or OpenCL. We show how such network acceleration enables an eco-system that can significantly speed up applications and system services.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Sandia National Laboratories", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "Sandia National Laboratories", "Sandia National Laboratories"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Torsten Hoefler.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hoefler:Torsten", "Salvatore Di Girolamo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Girolamo:Salvatore_Di", "Konstantin Taranov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Taranov:Konstantin", "Ryan E.
