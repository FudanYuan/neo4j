We address this problem by posing query-relevant summarization as a video frame subset selection problem, which lets us optimise for summaries which are simultaneously diverse, representative of the entire video, and relevant to a text query. We quantify relevance by measuring the distance between frames and queries in a common textual-visual semantic embedding space induced by a neural network. In addition, we extend the model to capture query-independent properties, such as frame quality. We compare our method against previous state of the art on textual-visual embeddings for thumbnail selection and show that our model outperforms them on relevance prediction. Furthermore, we introduce a new dataset, annotated with diversity and query-specific relevance labels. On this dataset, we train and test our complete model for video summarization and show that it outperforms standard baselines such as Maximal Marginal Relevance.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "authors": ["Arun Balajee Vasudevan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vasudevan:Arun_Balajee", "Michael Gygli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gygli:Michael", "Anna Volokitin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Volokitin:Anna", "Luc Van Gool.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gool:Luc_Van"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
