{"title": "Minimizing Quadratic Functions in Constant Time.", "fields": ["quadratic function", "quadratic equation", "bracket", "matrix", "mathematical analysis"], "abstract": "A sampling-based optimization method for quadratic functions is proposed. Our method approximately solves the following $n$-dimensional quadratic minimization problem in constant time, which is independent of $n$: $z^*=\\min_{\\bv \\in \\bbR^n}\\bracket{\\bv}{A \\bv} + n\\bracket{\\bv}{\\diag(\\bd)\\bv} + n\\bracket{\\bb}{\\bv}$, where $A \\in \\bbR^{n \\times n}$ is a matrix and $\\bd,\\bb \\in \\bbR^n$ are vectors. Our theoretical analysis specifies the number of samples $k(\\delta, \\epsilon)$ such that the approximated solution $z$ satisfies $|z - z^*| = O(\\epsilon n^2)$ with probability $1-\\delta$. The empirical performance (accuracy and runtime) is positively confirmed by numerical experiments.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["National Institute of Informatics", "National Institute of Informatics"], "authors": ["Kohei Hayashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hayashi:Kohei", "Yuichi Yoshida.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoshida:Yuichi"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
