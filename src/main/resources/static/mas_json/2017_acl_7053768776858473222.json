Although character-level language models offer a partial solution in that they can create word types not attested in the training corpus, they do not capture the \"bursty\" distribution of such words. In this paper, we augment a hierarchical LSTM language model that generates sequences of word tokens character by character with a caching mechanism that learns to reuse previously generated words. To validate our model we construct a new open-vocabulary language modeling corpus (the Multilingual Wikipedia Corpus, MWC) from comparable Wikipedia articles in 7 typologically diverse languages and demonstrate the effectiveness of our model across this range of languages.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "University of Oxford"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Kazuya Kawakami.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kawakami:Kazuya", "Chris Dyer.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dyer:Chris", "Phil Blunsom.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Blunsom:Phil"], "pages": 11}
