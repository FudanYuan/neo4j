The first class of problems involves a robot that must locate a hidden target in an environment that consists of a set of concurrent rays. The second class pertains to the design of interruptible algorithms by means of a schedule of contract algorithms. We study several variants of these families of problems, such as searching and scheduling with probabilistic considerations, redundancy and fault-tolerance issues, randomized strategies, and trade-offs between performance and preemptions. For many of these problems we present the first known results that apply to multi-ray and multi-problem domains. Our objective is to demonstrate that several well-motivated settings can be addressed using a common approach.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["University of Paris"], "authors": ["Spyros Angelopoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Angelopoulos_0001:Spyros"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2015", "pages": 7}
