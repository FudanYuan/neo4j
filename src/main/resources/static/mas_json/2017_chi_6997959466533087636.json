{"title": "Scalable Annotation of Fine-Grained Categories Without Experts.", "fields": ["crowdsourcing", "collie", "annotation", "scalability", "workflow"], "abstract": "We present a crowdsourcing workflow to collect image annotations for visually similar synthetic categories without requiring experts. In animals, there is a direct link between taxonomy and visual similarity: e.g. a collie (type of dog) looks more similar to other collies (e.g. smooth collie) than a greyhound (another type of dog). However, in synthetic categories such as cars, objects with similar taxonomy can have very different appearance: e.g. a 2011 Ford F-150 Supercrew-HD looks the same as a 2011 Ford F-150 Supercrew-LL but very different from a 2011 Ford F-150 Supercrew-SVT. We introduce a graph based crowdsourcing algorithm to automatically group visually indistinguishable objects together. Using our workflow, we label 712,430 images by ~1,000 Amazon Mechanical Turk workers; resulting in the largest fine-grained visual dataset reported to date with 2,657 categories of cars annotated at 1/20th the cost of hiring experts.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "University of Michigan", "Stanford University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Timnit Gebru.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gebru:Timnit", "Jonathan Krause.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Krause:Jonathan", "Jia Deng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Deng:Jia", "Fei-Fei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Fei=Fei"], "pages": 5}
