{"title": "Bunshin: Compositing Security Mechanisms through Diversification.", "fields": ["security testing", "countermeasure", "security bug", "asset", "security through obscurity"], "abstract": "A number of security mechanisms have been proposed to harden programs written in unsafe languages, each of which mitigates a specific type of memory error. Intuitively, enforcing multiple security mechanisms on a target program will improve its overall security. However, this is not yet a viable approach in practice because the execution slowdown caused by various security mechanisms is often non-linearly accumulated, making the combined protection prohibitively expensive; further, most security mechanisms are designed for independent or isolated uses and thus are often in conflict with each other, making it impossible to fuse them in a straightforward way.\n\nIn this paper, we present BUNSHIN, an N-versionbased system that enables different and even conflicting security mechanisms to be combined to secure a program while at the same time reducing the execution slowdown. In particular, we propose an automated mechanism to distribute runtime security checks in multiple program variants in such a way that conflicts between security checks are inherently eliminated and execution slowdown is minimized with parallel execution. We also present an N-version execution engine to seamlessly synchronize these variants so that all distributed security checks work together to guarantee the security of a target program.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Meng Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Meng", "Kangjie Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Kangjie", "Taesoo Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Taesoo", "Wenke Lee.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lee:Wenke"], "conf": "usenix", "year": "2017", "pages": 13}
