In this paper, we study the problem of how to make AL algorithms inherently safe while still meeting its learning objective. We consider a setting where the unknown reward function is assumed to be a linear combination of a set of state features, and the safety property is specified in Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL). By embedding probabilistic model checking inside AL, we propose a novel counterexample-guided approach that can ensure safety while retaining performance of the learnt policy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several challenging AL scenarios where safety is essential.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Boston University", "Boston University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Weichao Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Weichao", "Wenchao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Wenchao"], "pages": 19}
