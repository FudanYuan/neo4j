{"title": "AspecTiles: tile-based visualization of diversified web search results.", "fields": ["information seeking behavior", "web query classification", "query expansion", "web search query", "computer user satisfaction"], "abstract": "A diversified search result for an underspecified query generally contains web pages in which there are answers that are relevant to different aspects of the query. In order to help the user locate such relevant answers, we propose a simple extension to the standard Search Engine Result Page (SERP) interface, called AspecTiles. In addition to presenting a ranked list of URLs with their titles and snippets, AspecTiles visualizes the relevance degree of a document to each aspect by means of colored squares (\"tiles\"). To compare AspecTiles with the standard SERP interface in terms of usefulness, we conducted a user study involving 30 search tasks designed based on the TREC web diversity task topics as well as 32 participants. Our results show that AspecTiles has some advantages in terms of search performance, user behavior, and user satisfaction. First, AspecTiles enables the user to gather relevant information significantly more efficiently than the standard SERP interface for tasks where the user considers several different aspects of the query to be important at the same time (multi-aspect tasks). Second, AspecTiles affects the user's information seeking behavior: with this interface, we observed significantly fewer query reformulations, shorter queries and deeper examinations of ranked lists in multi-aspect tasks. Third, participants of our user study found AspecTiles significantly more useful for finding relevant information and easy to use than the standard SERP interface. These results suggest that simple interfaces like AspecTiles can enhance the search performance and search experience of the user when their queries are underspecified.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Osaka University", "Microsoft", "Kyoto University", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Mayu Iwata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Iwata:Mayu", "Tetsuya Sakai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sakai:Tetsuya", "Takehiro Yamamoto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yamamoto:Takehiro", "Yu Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Yu", "Yi Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yi", "Ji-Rong Wen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wen:Ji=Rong", "Shojiro Nishio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nishio:Shojiro"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2012", "pages": 10}
