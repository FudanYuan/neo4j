{"title": "Quantifying paedophile queries in a large P2P system.", "fields": ["domain knowledge", "peer to peer", "ground truth", "data collection", "server"], "abstract": "Increasing knowledge of paedophile activity in P2P systems is a crucial societal concern, with important consequences on child protection, policy making, and internet regulation. Because of a lack of traces of P2P exchanges and rigorous analysis methodology, however, current knowledge of this activity remains very limited. We consider here a widely used P2P system, eDonkey, and focus on two key statistics: the fraction of paedophile queries entered in the system and the fraction of users who entered such queries. We collect hundreds of millions of keyword-based queries; we design a paedophile query detection tool for which we establish false positive and false negative rates using assessment by experts; with this tool and these rates, we then estimate the fraction of paedophile queries in our data. We conclude that approximately 0.25% of queries are paedophile. Our statistics 1  are by far the most precise and reliable ever obtained in this domain.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique", "Centre national de la recherche scientifique"], "authors": ["Matthieu Latapy.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Latapy:Matthieu", "Cl\u00e9mence Magnien.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Magnien:Cl=eacute=mence", "Rapha\u00ebl Fournier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fournier:Rapha=euml=l"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2011", "pages": 5}
