{"title": "Spatial pyramid co-occurrence for image classification.", "fields": ["reference frame", "contextual image classification", "space partitioning", "pyramid", "visual word"], "abstract": "We describe a novel image representation termed spatial pyramid co-occurrence which characterizes both the photometric and geometric aspects of an image. Specifically, the co-occurrences of visual words are computed with respect to spatial predicates over a hierarchical spatial partitioning of an image. The representation captures both the absolute and relative spatial arrangement of the words and, through the choice and combination of the predicates, can characterize a variety of spatial relationships. Our representation is motivated by the analysis of overhead imagery such as from satellites or aircraft. This imagery generally does not have an absolute reference frame and thus the relative spatial arrangement of the image elements often becomes the key discriminating feature. We validate this hypothesis using a challenging ground truth image dataset of 21 land-use classes manually extracted from high-resolution aerial imagery. Our approach is shown to result in higher classification rates than a non-spatial bagof- visual-words approach as well as a popular approach for characterizing the absolute spatial arrangement of visual words, the spatial pyramid representation of Lazebnik et al. [7]. While our primary objective is analyzing overhead imagery, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Graz-01 object class dataset and performs competitively on the 15 Scene dataset.", "citation": "Citations (261)", "year": "2011", "departments": ["University of California, Merced", "University of California, Merced"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Yi Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0016:Yi", "Shawn D.
