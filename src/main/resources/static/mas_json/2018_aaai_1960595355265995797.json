{"title": "Approximate Inference via Weighted Rademacher Complexity.", "fields": ["rademacher complexity", "approximate inference", "ising model", "class size", "lemma"], "abstract": "Rademacher complexity is often used to characterize the learnability of a hypothesis class and is known to be related to the class size. We leverage this observation and introduce a new technique for estimating the size of an arbitrary weighted set, defined as the sum of weights of all elements in the set. Our technique provides upper and lower bounds on a novel generalization of Rademacher complexity to the weighted setting in terms of the weighted set size. This generalizes Massart's Lemma, a known upper bound on the Rademacher complexity in terms of the unweighted set size. We show that the weighted Rademacher complexity can be estimated by solving a randomly perturbed optimization problem, allowing us to derive high-probability bounds on the size of any weighted set. We apply our method to the problems of calculating the partition function of an Ising model and computing propositional model counts (#SAT). Our experiments demonstrate that we can produce tighter bounds than competing methods in both the weighted and unweighted settings.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["IBM", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Jonathan Kuck.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kuck:Jonathan", "Ashish Sabharwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sabharwal:Ashish", "Stefano Ermon.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ermon:Stefano"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
