{"title": "MacroBase: Prioritizing Attention in Fast Data.", "fields": ["alpha", "single core", "modular design", "data stream mining", "telematics"], "abstract": "As data volumes continue to rise, manual inspection is becoming increasingly untenable. In response, we present MacroBase, a data analytics engine that prioritizes end-user attention in high-volume fast data streams. MacroBase enables efficient, accurate, and modular analyses that highlight and aggregate important and unusual behavior, acting as a search engine for fast data. MacroBase is able to deliver order-of-magnitude speedups over alternatives by optimizing the combination of explanation and classification tasks and by leveraging a new reservoir sampler and heavy-hitters sketch specialized for fast data streams. As a result, MacroBase delivers accurate results at speeds of up to 2M events per second per query on a single core. The system has delivered meaningful results in production, including at a telematics company monitoring hundreds of thousands of vehicles.", "citation": "Citations (22)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Peter Bailis.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bailis:Peter", "Edward Gan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gan:Edward", "Samuel Madden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Madden:Samuel", "Deepak Narayanan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Narayanan:Deepak", "Kexin Rong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rong:Kexin", "Sahaana Suri.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Suri:Sahaana"], "pages": 16}
