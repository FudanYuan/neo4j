{"title": "A Theoretical Framework of the Graph Shift Algorithm.", "fields": ["convergence", "graph", "subsequence", "mathematical optimization", "similarity measure"], "abstract": "Since no theoretical foundations for proving the convergence of Graph Shift Algorithm have been reported, we provide a generic framework consisting of three key GS components to fit the Zangwill's convergence theorem. We show that the sequence set generated by the GS procedures always terminates at a local maximum, or at worst, contains a subsequence which converges to a local maximum of the similarity measure function. What is more, a theoretical framework is proposed to apply our proof to a more general case.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Technology, Sydney", "University of Technology, Sydney"], "authors": ["Xuhui Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Xuhui", "Longbing Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Longbing"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2012", "pages": -1}
