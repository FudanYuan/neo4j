{"title": "A strongly polynomial algorithm for generalized flow maximization.", "fields": ["square free polynomial", "wilkinson s polynomial", "reciprocal polynomial", "polynomial long division", "alternating polynomial"], "abstract": "A strongly polynomial algorithm is given for the generalized flow maximization problem. It uses a new variant of the scaling technique called continuous scaling. The main measure of progress is that within a strongly polynomial number of steps, an arc can be identified that must be tight in every dual optimal solution and thus can be contracted. As a consequence of the result, we also obtain a strongly polynomial algorithm for the linear feasibility problem with at most two nonzero entries per column in the constraint matrix.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["London School of Economics and Political Science"], "conf": "stoc", "authors": ["L\u00e1szl\u00f3 A.
