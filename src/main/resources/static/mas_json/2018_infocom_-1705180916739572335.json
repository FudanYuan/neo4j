{"title": "Linear Block Coding for Efficient Beam Discovery in Millimeter Wave Communication Networks.", "fields": ["block code", "mobile broadband", "small number", "linear code", "channel"], "abstract": "The surge in mobile broadband data demands is expected to surpass the available spectrum capacity below 6 GHz. This expectation has prompted the exploration of millimeter wave (mm-wave) frequency bands as a candidate technology for next generation wireless networks. However, numerous challenges to deploying mm-wave communication systems, including channel estimation, need to be met before practical deployments are possible. This work addresses the mm-wave channel estimation problem and treats it as a beam discovery problem in which locating beams with strong path reflectors is analogous to locating errors in linear block codes. We show that a significantly small number of measurements (compared to the original dimensions of the channel matrix) is sufficient to reliably estimate the channel. We also show that this can be achieved using a simple and energy-efficient transceiver architecture.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University"], "authors": ["Yahia Shabara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shabara:Yahia", "C.
