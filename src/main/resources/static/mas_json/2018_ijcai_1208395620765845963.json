{"title": "Long-Term Human Motion Prediction by Modeling Motion Context and Enhancing Motion Dynamics.", "fields": ["machine learning", "pattern recognition", "recurrent neural network", "artificial intelligence", "context model"], "abstract": "Human motion prediction aims at generating future frames of human motion based on an observed sequence of skeletons. Recent methods employ the latest hidden states of a recurrent neural network (RNN) to encode the historical skeletons, which can only address short-term prediction. In this work, we propose a motion context modeling by summarizing the historical human motion with respect to the current prediction. A modified highway unit (MHU) is proposed for efficiently eliminating motionless joints and estimating next pose given the motion context. Furthermore, we enhance the motion dynamic by minimizing the gram matrix loss for long-term motion prediction. Experimental results show that the proposed model can promisingly forecast the human future movements, which yields superior performances over related state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, specifying the motion context with the activity labels enables our model to perform human motion transfer.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Sun Yat-sen University", "Tencent", "Tencent", "Sun Yat-sen University"], "authors": ["Yongyi Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Yongyi", "Lin Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Lin", "Wei Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Wei", "Wei-Shi Zheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zheng:Wei=Shi"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
