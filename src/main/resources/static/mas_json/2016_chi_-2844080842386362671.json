{"title": "Empath: Understanding Topic Signals in Large-Scale Text.", "fields": ["small set", "deep learning", "part of speech", "social computing", "small number"], "abstract": "Human language is colored by a broad range of topics, but existing text analysis tools only focus on a small number of them. We present Empath, a tool that can generate and validate new lexical categories on demand from a small set of seed terms (like \"bleed\" and \"punch\" to generate the category violence). Empath draws connotations between words and phrases by deep learning a neural embedding across more than 1.8 billion words of modern fiction. Given a small set of seed words that characterize a category, Empath uses its neural embedding to discover new related terms, then validates the category with a crowd-powered filter. Empath also analyzes text across 200 built-in, pre-validated categories we have generated from common topics in our web dataset, like neglect, government, and social media. We show that Empath's data-driven, human validated categories are highly correlated (r=0.906) with similar categories in LIWC.", "citation": "Citations (30)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Ethan Fast.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fast:Ethan", "Binbin Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Binbin", "Michael S.
