Yet software architects lack support for evaluating uncertainty, its impact on risk, and the value of reducing uncertainty before making critical decisions. We propose to apply decision analysis and multi-objective optimisation techniques to provide such support. We present a systematic method allowing software architects to describe uncertainty about the impact of alternatives on stakeholders' goals; to calculate the consequences of uncertainty through Monte-Carlo simulation; to shortlist candidate architectures based on expected costs, benefits and risks; and to assess the value of obtaining additional information before deciding. We demonstrate our method on the design of a system for coordinating emergency response teams. Our approach highlights the need for requirements engineering and software cost estimation methods to disclose uncertainty instead of hiding it.", "citation": "Citations (68)", "departments": ["University College London", "University College London", "University College London"], "authors": ["Emmanuel Letier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Letier:Emmanuel", "David Stefan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stefan:David", "Earl T.
