{"title": "View-Volume Network for Semantic Scene Completion from a Single Depth Image.", "fields": ["depth map", "feature extraction", "convolutional neural network", "pattern recognition", "differentiable function"], "abstract": "We introduce a View-Volume convolutional neural network (VVNet) for inferring the occupancy and semantic labels of a volumetric 3D scene from a single depth image. The VVNet concatenates a 2D view CNN and a 3D volume CNN with a differentiable projection layer. Given a single RGBD image, our method extracts the detailed geometric features from the input depth image with a 2D view CNN and then projects the features into a 3D volume according to the input depth map via a projection layer. After that, we learn the 3D context information of the scene with a 3D volume CNN for computing the result volumetric occupancy and semantic labels. With combined 2D and 3D representations, the VVNet efficiently reduces the computational cost, enables feature extraction from multi-channel high resolution inputs, and thus significantly improves the result accuracy. We validate our method and demonstrate its efficiency and effectiveness on both synthetic SUNCG and real NYU dataset.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Yuxiao Guo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guo:Yuxiao", "Xin Tong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tong:Xin"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
