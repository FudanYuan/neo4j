We conducted a survey with Microsoft engineers on inter-team coordination and found that the most impactful problems concerned finding and keeping track of other engineers. Since engineers are connected by their shared work, a tool that discovers connections in their work-related repositories can help.   Here we describe the Codebook framework for mining software repositories. It is flexible enough to address all of the problems identified by our survey with a single data structure (graph of people and artifacts) and a single algorithm (regular language reachability). Codebook handles a larger variety of problems than prior work, analyzes more kinds of work artifacts, and can be customized by and for end-users. To evaluate our framework's flexibility, we built two applications, Hoozizat and Deep Intellisense. We evaluated these applications with engineers to show effectiveness in addressing multiple inter-team coordination problems.", "citation": "Citations (205)", "departments": ["Microsoft", "University of Maryland, College Park", "Microsoft"], "authors": ["Andrew Begel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Begel:Andrew", "Yit Phang Khoo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Khoo:Yit_Phang", "Thomas Zimmermann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zimmermann_0001:Thomas"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
