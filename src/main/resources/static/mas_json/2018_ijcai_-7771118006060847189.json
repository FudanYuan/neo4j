{"title": "MEGAN: Mixture of Experts of Generative Adversarial Networks for Multimodal Image Generation.", "fields": ["modalities", "generative grammar", "adversarial system", "mixture of experts", "structural similarity"], "abstract": "Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown promising performance in generating realistic images. However, they often struggle in learning complex underlying modalities in a given dataset, resulting in poor-quality generated images. To mitigate this problem, we present a novel approach called mixture of experts GAN (MEGAN), an ensemble approach of multiple generator networks. Each generator network in MEGAN specializes in generating images with a particular subset of modalities, e.g., an image class. Instead of incorporating a separate step of handcrafted clustering of multiple modalities, our proposed model is trained through an end-to-end learning of multiple generators via gating networks, which is responsible for choosing the appropriate generator network for a given condition. We adopt the categorical reparameterization trick for a categorical decision to be made in selecting a generator while maintaining the flow of the gradients. We demonstrate that individual generators learn different and salient subparts of the data and achieve a multiscale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) score of 0.2470 for CelebA and a competitive unsupervised inception score of 8.33 in CIFAR-10.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Korea University", "Korea University", "Korea University", "Korea University", "University of North Carolina at Charlotte"], "authors": ["David Keetae Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:David_Keetae", "Seungjoo Yoo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yoo:Seungjoo", "Hyojin Bahng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bahng:Hyojin", "Jaegul Choo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choo:Jaegul", "Noseong Park.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Park:Noseong"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2018", "pages": 7}
