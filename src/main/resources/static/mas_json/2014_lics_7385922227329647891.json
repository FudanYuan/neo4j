Mostly relying on results about polynomials with exponentiation that have not been used in our context, we derive: that the usual finite axiomatization known as High-School Identities (HSI) is complete for a significant subclass of types; that it is decidable for that subclass when two types are isomorphic; that, for the whole of the set of types, a recursive extension of the axioms of HSI exists that is complete; and that, for the whole of the set of types, the question as to whether two types are isomorphic is decidable when base types are to be interpreted as finite sets. We also point out certain related open problems.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2014", "departments": [], "conf": "lics", "authors": ["Danko Ilik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Ilik:Danko"], "pages": 7}
