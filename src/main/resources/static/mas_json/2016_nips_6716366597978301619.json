In order to capture some of these advantages in machine perception, we ask two questions: whether deep neural networks can learn universal image representations, useful not only for a single task but for all of them, and how the solutions to the different tasks can be integrated in this framework. We answer by proposing a new architecture, which we call multinet, in which not only deep image features are shared between tasks, but where tasks can interact in a recurrent manner by encoding the results of their analysis in a common shared representation of the data. In this manner, we show that the performance of individual tasks in standard benchmarks can be improved first by sharing features between them and then, more significantly, by integrating their solutions in the common representation.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Oxford"], "authors": ["Hakan Bilen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bilen:Hakan", "Andrea Vedaldi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vedaldi:Andrea"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
