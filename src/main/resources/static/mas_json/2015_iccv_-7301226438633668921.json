Our m-CNN provides an end-to-end framework with convolutional architectures to exploit image representation, word composition, and the matching relations between the two modalities. More specifically, it consists of one image CNN encoding the image content and one matching CNN modeling the joint representation of image and sentence. The matching CNN composes different semantic fragments from words and learns the inter-modal relations between image and the composed fragments at different levels, thus fully exploit the matching relations between image and sentence. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed m-CNNs can effectively capture the information necessary for image and sentence matching. More specifically, our proposed m-CNNs significantly outperform the state-of-the-art approaches for bidirectional image and sentence retrieval on the Flickr8K and Flickr30K datasets.", "citation": "Citations (115)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["Huawei", "Huawei", "Huawei", "Huawei"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Lin Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Lin", "Zhengdong Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Zhengdong", "Lifeng Shang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shang:Lifeng", "Hang Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li_0001:Hang"], "pages": 9}
