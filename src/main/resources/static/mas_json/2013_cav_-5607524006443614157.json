{"title": "Automatic Abstraction in SMT-Based Unbounded Software Model Checking.", "fields": ["satisfiability modulo theories", "horn clause", "mathematical proof", "software verification", "counterexample"], "abstract": "Software model checkers based on under-approximations and SMT solvers are very successful at verifying safety (i.e., reachability) properties. They combine two key ideas --- (a) concreteness: a counterexample in an under-approximation is a counterexample in the original program as well, and (b) generalization: a proof of safety of an under-approximation, produced by an SMT solver, are generalizable to proofs of safety of the original program. In this paper, we present a combination of automatic abstraction with the under-approximation-driven framework. We explore two iterative approaches for obtaining and refining abstractions --- proof based and counterexample based --- and show how they can be combined into a unified algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of Proof-Based Abstraction, primarily used to verify hardware, to Software Verification. We have implemented a prototype of the framework using Z3, and evaluate it on many benchmarks from the Software Verification Competition. We show experimentally that our combination is quite effective on hard instances.", "citation": "Citations (33)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Anvesh Komuravelli.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Komuravelli:Anvesh", "Arie Gurfinkel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gurfinkel:Arie", "Sagar Chaki.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chaki:Sagar", "Edmund M.
