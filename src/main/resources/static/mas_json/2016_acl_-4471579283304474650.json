{"title": "CFO: Conditional Focused Neural Question Answering with Large-scale Knowledge Bases.", "fields": ["probabilistic logic", "question answering", "expression", "factoid", "recurrent neural network"], "abstract": "How can we enable computers to automatically answer questions like \"Who created the character Harry Potter\"? Carefully built knowledge bases provide rich sources of facts. However, it remains a challenge to answer factoid questions raised in natural language due to numerous expressions of one question. In particular, we focus on the most common questions --- ones that can be answered with a single fact in the knowledge base. We propose CFO, a Conditional Focused neural-network-based approach to answering factoid questions with knowledge bases. Our approach first zooms in a question to find more probable candidate subject mentions, and infers the final answers with a unified conditional probabilistic framework. Powered by deep recurrent neural networks and neural embeddings, our proposed CFO achieves an accuracy of 75.7% on a dataset of 108k questions - the largest public one to date. It outperforms the current state of the art by an absolute margin of 11.8%.", "citation": "Citations (10)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Zihang Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Zihang", "Lei Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Lei", "Wei Xu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xu:Wei"], "pages": -1}
