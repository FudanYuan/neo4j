{"title": "On Using Floating-Point Computations to Help an Exact Linear Arithmetic Decision Procedure.", "fields": ["satisfiability modulo theories", "floating point", "decision problem", "boolean satisfiability problem", "rational number"], "abstract": "We consider the decision problem for quantifier-free formulas whose atoms are linear inequalities interpreted over the reals or rationals. This problem may be decided using satisfiability modulo theory (SMT), using a mixture of a SAT solver and a simplex-based decision procedure for conjunctions. State-of-the-art SMT solvers use simplex implementations over rational numbers, which perform well for typical problems arising from model-checking and program analysis (sparse inequalities, small coefficients) but are slow for other applications (denser problems, larger coefficients).\n\nWe propose a simple preprocessing phase that can be adapted to existing SMT solvers and that may be optionally triggered. Despite using floating-point computations, our method is sound and complete -- it merely affects efficiency. We implemented the method and provide benchmarks showing that this change brings a naive and slow decision procedure (\"textbook simplex\" with rational numbers) up to the efficiency of recent SMT solvers, over test cases arising from model-checking, and makes it definitely faster than state-of-the-art SMT solvers on dense examples.", "citation": "Citations (16)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Verimag,"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["David Monniaux.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Monniaux:David"], "pages": 14}
