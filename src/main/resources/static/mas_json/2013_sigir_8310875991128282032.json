In particular, we propose a query-adaptive weighting method that can dynamically aggregate and score evidence in multiple medical reports (from different hospital departments or from different tests within the same department) of a patient. Furthermore, we explore several informative features for learning our retrieval model.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "departments": ["University of Delaware", "University of Delaware"], "authors": ["Dongqing Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Dongqing", "Ben Carterette.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carterette:Ben"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
