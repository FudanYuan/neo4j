{"title": "Achieving delay rate-function optimality in OFDM downlink with time-correlated channels.", "fields": ["network packet", "orthogonal frequency division multiplexing", "rate function", "fading", "telecommunications link"], "abstract": "There have been recent attempts to develop scheduling schemes for downlink transmission in a single cell of a multi-channel (e.g., OFDM-based) cellular network. These works have been quite promising in that they have developed low-complexity index scheduling policies that are delay-optimal (in a large deviation rate-function sense). However, these policies require that the channel is ON or OFF in each time-slot with a fixed probability (i.e., there is no memory in the system), while the reality is that due to channel fading and doppler shift, channels are often time-correlated in these cellular systems. Thus, an important open question is whether one can find simple index scheduling policies that are delay-optimal even when the channels are time-correlated. In this paper, we attempt to answer this question for time-correlated ON/OFF channels. In particular, we show that the class of oldest packets first (OPF) policies that give a higher priority to packets with a large delay is delay rate-function optimal under two conditions: 1) The channel is non-negatively correlated, and 2) The distribution of the OFF period is geometric. We use simulations to further elucidate the theoretical results.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Temple University", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University"], "authors": ["Zhenzhi Qian.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/q/Qian:Zhenzhi", "Bo Ji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Ji:Bo", "Kannan Srinivasan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Srinivasan:Kannan", "Ness B.
