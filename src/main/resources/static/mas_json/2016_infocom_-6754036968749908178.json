In this paper we investigate the community detection problem based on the concept of terminal set. A terminal set is a group of users within which any two users belong to different communities. Although the community detection is hard in general, the terminal set can be very helpful in designing effective community detection algorithms. We first present a 2-approximation algorithm running in polynomial time for the original community detection problem. In the other issue, in order to better support real applications we further consider the case when extra restrictions are imposed on feasible partitions. For such customized community detection problems, we provide two randomized algorithms which are able to find the optimal partition with a high probability. Demonstrated by the experiments performed on benchmark networks the proposed algorithms are able to produce high-quality communities.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas", "Taiyuan University of Technology", "University of Texas at Dallas", "University of Texas at Dallas"], "authors": ["Guangmo Tong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tong:Guangmo", "Lei Cui.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cui:Lei", "Weili Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Weili", "Cong Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu_0005:Cong", "Ding-Zhu Du.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Du:Ding=Zhu"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2016", "pages": 9}
