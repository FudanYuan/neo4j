{"title": "Sequential Plan Recognition.", "fields": ["maximum likelihood", "data mining", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Plan recognition algorithms infer agents' plans from their observed actions. Due to imperfect knowledge about the agent's behavior and the environment, it is often the case that there are multiple hypotheses about an agent's plans that are consistent with the observations, though only one of these hypotheses is correct. This paper addresses the problem of how to disambiguate between hypotheses, by querying the acting agent about whether a candidate plan in one of the hypotheses matches its intentions. This process is performed sequentially and used to update the set of possible hypotheses during the recognition process. The paper defines the sequential plan recognition process (SPRP), which seeks to reduce the number of hypotheses using a minimal number of queries. We propose a number of policies for the SPRP which use maximum likelihood and information gain to choose which plan to query. We show this approach works well in practice on two domains from the literature, significantly reducing the number of hypotheses using fewer queries than a baseline approach. Our results can inform the design of future plan recognition systems that interleave the recognition process with intelligent interventions of their users.", "citation": "Citations (5)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev", "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Reuth Mirsky.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mirsky:Reuth", "Roni Stern.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stern:Roni", "Ya'akov (Kobi) Gal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gal:Ya=akov_=Kobi=", "Meir Kalech.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kalech:Meir"], "pages": 7}
