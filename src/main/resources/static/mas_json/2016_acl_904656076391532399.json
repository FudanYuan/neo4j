{"title": "Stack-propagation: Improved Representation Learning for Syntax.", "fields": ["graph", "feature learning", "template", "dependency grammar", "parsing"], "abstract": "Traditional syntax models typically leverage part-of-speech (POS) information by constructing features from hand-tuned templates. We demonstrate that a better approach is to utilize POS tags as a regularizer of learned representations. We propose a simple method for learning a stacked pipeline of models which we call \u201cstack-propagation\u201d. We apply this to dependency parsing and tagging, where we use the hidden layer of the tagger network as a representation of the input tokens for the parser. At test time, our parser does not require predicted POS tags. On 19 languages from the Universal Dependencies, our method is 1.3% (absolute) more accurate than a state-of-the-art graph-based approach and 2.7% more accurate than the most comparable greedy model.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Google"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Yuan Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Yuan", "David Weiss.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Weiss:David"], "pages": -1}
