{"title": "Document Retrieval Using Entity-Based Language Models.", "fields": ["rdf query language", "term discrimination", "universal networking language", "cognitive models of information retrieval", "data control language"], "abstract": "We address the ad hoc document retrieval task by devising novel types of entity-based language models. The models utilize information about single terms in the query and documents as well as term sequences marked as entities by some entity-linking tool. The key principle of the language models is accounting, simultaneously, for the uncertainty inherent in the entity-markup process and the balance between using entity-based and term-based information. Empirical evaluation demonstrates the merits of using the language models for retrieval. For example, the performance transcends that of a state-of-the-art term proximity method. We also show that the language models can be effectively used for cluster-based document retrieval and query expansion.", "citation": "Citations (23)", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "Yahoo!"], "authors": ["Hadas Raviv.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raviv:Hadas", "Oren Kurland.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kurland:Oren", "David Carmel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Carmel:David"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
