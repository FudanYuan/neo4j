{"title": "Inverted indexes for phrases and strings.", "fields": ["phrase search", "substring", "prefix", "succinct data structure", "inverted index"], "abstract": "Inverted indexes are the most fundamental and widely used data structures in information retrieval. For each unique word occurring in a document collection, the inverted index stores a list of the documents in which this word occurs. Compression techniques are often applied to further reduce the space requirement of these lists. However, the index has a shortcoming, in that only predefined pattern queries can be supported efficiently. In terms of string documents where word boundaries are undefined, if we have to index all the substrings of a given document, then the storage quickly becomes quadratic in the data size. Also, if we want to apply the same type of indexes for querying phrases or sequence of words, then the inverted index will end up storing redundant information. In this paper, we show the first set of inverted indexes which work naturally for strings as well as phrase searching. The central idea is to exclude document  d  in the inverted list of a string  P  if every occurrence of  P  in  d  is subsumed by another string of which  P  is a prefix. With this we show that our space utilization is close to the optimal. Techniques from succinct data structures are deployed to achieve compression while allowing fast access in terms of frequency and document id based retrieval. Compression and speed trade-offs are evaluated for different variants of the proposed index. For phrase searching, we show that our indexes compare favorably against a typical inverted index deploying position-wise intersections. We also show efficient top- k  based retrieval under relevance metrics like frequency and  tf-idf .", "citation": "Citations (54)", "departments": ["Louisiana State University", "Louisiana State University", "Louisiana State University", "National Tsing Hua University", "University of Kansas"], "authors": ["Manish Patil.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Patil:Manish", "Sharma V.
