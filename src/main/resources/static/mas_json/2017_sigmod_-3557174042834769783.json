{"title": "FPGA-based Data Partitioning.", "fields": ["operator", "hash join", "central processing unit", "thread", "hardware acceleration"], "abstract": "Implementing parallel operators in multi-core machines often involves a data partitioning step that divides the data into cache-size blocks and arranges them so to allow concurrent threads to process them in parallel. Data partitioning is expensive, in some cases up to 90% of the cost of, e.g., a parallel hash join. In this paper we explore the use of an FPGA to accelerate data partitioning. We do so in the context of new hybrid architectures where the FPGA is located as a co-processor residing on a socket and with coherent access to the same memory as the CPU residing on the other socket. Such an architecture reduces data transfer overheads between the CPU and the FPGA, enabling hybrid operator execution where the partitioning happens on the FPGA and the build and probe phases of a join happen on the CPU. Our experiments demonstrate that FPGA-based partitioning is significantly faster and more robust than CPU-based partitioning. The results open interesting options as FPGAs are gradually integrated tighter with the CPU.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich", "ETH Zurich"], "conf": "sigmod", "authors": ["Kaan Kara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kara:Kaan", "Jana Giceva.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Giceva:Jana", "Gustavo Alonso.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alonso:Gustavo"], "pages": 13}
