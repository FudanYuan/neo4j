{"title": "Mem2Seq: Effectively Incorporating Knowledge Bases into End-to-End Task-Oriented Dialog Systems.", "fields": ["dialog box", "differentiable function", "pointer", "end to end principle", "generative model"], "abstract": "End-to-end task-oriented dialog systems usually suffer from the challenge of incorporating knowledge bases. In this paper, we propose a novel yet simple end-to-end differentiable model called memory-to-sequence (Mem2Seq) to address this issue. Mem2Seq is the first neural generative model that combines the multi-hop attention over memories with the idea of pointer network. We empirically show how Mem2Seq controls each generation step, and how its multi-hop attention mechanism helps in learning correlations between memories. In addition, our model is quite general without complicated task-specific designs. As a result, we show that Mem2Seq can be trained faster and attain the state-of-the-art performance on three different task-oriented dialog datasets.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Pascale Fung.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fung:Pascale", "Chien-Sheng Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Chien=Sheng", "Andrea Madotto.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Madotto:Andrea"], "pages": 11}
