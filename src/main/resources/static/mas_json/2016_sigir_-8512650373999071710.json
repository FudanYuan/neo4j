{"title": "Where the Event Lies: Predicting Event Occurrence in Textual Documents.", "fields": ["data mining", "pattern recognition", "complex event processing", "artificial intelligence", "information retrieval"], "abstract": "Manually inspecting text in a document collection to assess whether an event occurs in it is a cumbersome task. Although a manual inspection can allow one to identify and discard false events, it becomes infeasible with increasing numbers of automatically detected events. In this paper, we present a system to automatize event validation, defined as the task of determining whether a given event occurs in a given document or corpus. In addition to supporting users seeking for information that corroborates a given event, event validation can also boost the precision of automatically detected event sets by discarding false events and preserving the true ones. The system allows to specify events, retrieves candidate web documents, and assesses whether events occur in them. The validation results are shown to the user, who can revise the decision of the system. The validation method relies on a supervised model to predict the occurrence of events in a non-annotated corpus. This system can also be used to build ground-truths for event corpora.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["L3S Research Ce ... nnover, Germany", "L3S Research Ce ... nnover, Germany", "L3S Research Ce ... nnover, Germany", "L3S Research Ce ... nnover, Germany", "L3S Research Ce ... nnover, Germany"], "authors": ["Andrea Ceroni.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Ceroni:Andrea", "Ujwal Gadiraju.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gadiraju:Ujwal", "Jan Matschke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matschke:Jan", "Simon Wingert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wingert:Simon", "Marco Fisichella.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fisichella:Marco"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2016", "pages": 4}
