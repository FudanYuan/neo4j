Current approaches have mainly relied on rigid rules and handcrafted features devised by a few experts, limiting themselves in terms of flexible applicability and robustness due to diverse bug patterns and characteristics existing in sophisticated real-world software programs. In this paper, we propose a novel, data-driven approach that is completely end-to-end without requiring any hand-crafted features, thus free from any program language-specific structural limitations. In particular, our approach leverages a recently proposed neural network model called memory networks that have shown the state-of-the-art performances mainly in question-answering tasks. Our experimental results using source codes demonstrate that our proposed model is capable of accurately detecting simple buffer overruns. We also present in-depth analyses on how a memory network can learn to understand the semantics in programming languages solely from raw source codes, such as tracing variables of interest, identifying numerical values, and performing their quantitative comparisons.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["Korea University", "Korea University", "Korea University", "Korea University"], "authors": ["Min-Je Choi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choi:Min=Je", "Sehun Jeong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jeong:Sehun", "Hakjoo Oh.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Oh:Hakjoo", "Jaegul Choo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Choo:Jaegul"], "conf": "ijcai", "year": "2017", "pages": 8}
