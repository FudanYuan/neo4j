{"title": "Navigating heterogeneous processors with market mechanisms.", "fields": ["homogeneous", "response time", "xeon", "valuation", "cloud computing"], "abstract": "Specialization of datacenter resources brings performance and energy improvements in response to the growing scale and diversity of cloud applications. Yet heterogeneous hardware adds complexity and volatility to latency-sensitive applications. A resource allocation mechanism that leverages architectural principles can overcome both of these obstacles. We integrate research in heterogeneous architectures with recent advances in multi-agent systems. Embedding architectural insight into proxies that bid on behalf of applications, a market effectively allocates hardware to applications with diverse preferences and valuations. Exploring a space of heterogeneous datacenter configurations, which mix server-class Xeon and mobile-class Atom processors, we find an optimal heterogeneous balance that improves both welfare and energy-efficiency. We further design and evaluate twelve design points along the Xeon-to-Atom spectrum, and find that a mix of three processor architectures achieves a 12\u00d7 reduction in response time violations relative to equal-power homogeneous systems.", "citation": "Citations (63)", "departments": ["Duke University", "Boston University", "Duke University"], "authors": ["Marisabel Guevara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guevara:Marisabel", "Benjamin Lubin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lubin:Benjamin", "Benjamin C.
