Therefore, digital evidence on smartphones plays an increasingly important role in crime investigations. Digital evidence could reside in the memory and permanent storage of a smartphone. While we have witnessed significant progresses on memory forensics recently, identifying evidence in the permanent storage is still an underdeveloped research area. Most existing studies on permanent-storage forensics rely on manual analysis or keyword-based scanning of the permanent storage. Manual analysis is costly, while keyword matching often misses the evidentiary data that do not have interesting keywords. \nIn this work, we develop a tool called EviHunter to automatically identify evidentiary data in the permanent storage of an Android device. There could be thousands of files on the permanent storage of a smartphone. A basic question a forensic investigator often faces is which files could store evidentiary data. EviHunter aims to answer this question. Our intuition is that the evidentiary data were produced by apps; and an app's code has rich information about the types of data the app may write to a permanent storage and the files the data are written to. Therefore, EviHunter first pre-computes an App Evidence Database (AED) via static analysis of a large number of apps. The AED includes the types of evidentiary data and files that store them for each app. Then, EviHunter matches the files on a smartphone's permanent storage against the AED to identify the files that could store evidentiary data. \nWe evaluate EviHunter on benchmark apps and 8,690 real-world apps. Our results show that EviHunter can precisely identify both the types of evidentiary data and the files that store them.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "Iowa State University", "Iowa State University"], "conf": "ccs", "authors": ["Chris Chao-Chun Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Chris_Chao=Chun", "Chen Shi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shi:Chen", "Neil Zhenqiang Gong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gong:Neil_Zhenqiang", "Yong Guan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guan:Yong"], "pages": 13}
