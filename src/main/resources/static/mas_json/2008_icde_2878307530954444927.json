U-relations support attribute-level uncertainty using vertical partitioning. If we consider positive relational algebra extended by an operation for computing possible answers, a query on the logical level can be translated into, and evaluated as, a single relational algebra query on the U-relational representation. The translation scheme essentially preserves the size of the query in terms of number of operations and, in particular, number of joins. Standard techniques employed in off-the-shelf relational database management systems are effective for optimizing and processing queries on U-relations. In our experiments we show that query evaluation on U-relations scales to large amounts of data with high degrees of uncertainty.", "citation": "Citations (293)", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Saarland University"], "authors": ["Lyublena Antova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Antova:Lyublena", "Thomas Jansen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/j/Jansen_0004:Thomas", "Christoph Koch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Koch_0001:Christoph", "Dan Olteanu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/o/Olteanu:Dan"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2008", "pages": 10}
