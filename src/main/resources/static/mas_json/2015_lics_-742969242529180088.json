As our first result we prove that the model of dense-timed PDA of Abdulla et al. Collapses: it is expressively equivalent to dense-timed PDA with timeless stack. Motivated by this result, we advocate the framework of first-order definable PDA, a specialization of PDA in sets with atoms, as the right setting to define and investigate timed extensions of PDA. The general model obtained in this way is Turing complete. As our second result we prove NEXPTIME upper complexity bound for the non-emptiness problem for an expressive subclass. As a byproduct, we obtain a tight EXPTIME complexity bound for a more restrictive subclass of PDA with timeless stack, thus subsuming the complexity bound known for dense-timed PDA.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["Instytut Informatyki", "Instytut Informatyki"], "authors": ["Lorenzo Clemente.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Clemente:Lorenzo", "Slawomir Lasota.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lasota:Slawomir"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2015", "pages": 12}
