{"title": "Regular combinators for string transformations.", "fields": ["monoid", "algebraic number", "concatenation", "commutative property", "iterated function"], "abstract": "We focus on (partial) functions that map input strings to a monoid such as the set of integers with addition and the set of output strings with concatenation. The notion of regularity for such functions has been defined using two-way finite-state transducers, (one-way) cost register automata, and MSO-definable graph transformations. In this paper, we give an algebraic and machine-independent characterization of this class analogous to the definition of regular languages by regular expressions. When the monoid is commutative, we prove that every regular function can be constructed from constant functions using the combinators of choice, split sum, and iterated sum, that are analogs of union, concatenation, and Kleene-*, respectively, but enforce unique (or unambiguous) parsing. Our main result is for the general case of non-commutative monoids, which is of particular interest for capturing regular string-to-string transformations for document processing. We prove that the following additional combinators suffice for constructing all regular functions: (1) the left-additive versions of split sum and iterated sum, which allow transformations such as string reversal; (2) sum of functions, which allows transformations such as copying of strings; and (3) function composition, or alternatively, a new concept of chained sum, which allows output values from adjacent blocks to mix.", "citation": "Citations (15)", "departments": ["University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of Pennsylvania"], "authors": ["Rajeev Alur.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Alur:Rajeev", "Adam Freilich.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Freilich:Adam", "Mukund Raghothaman.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raghothaman:Mukund"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2014", "pages": 10}
