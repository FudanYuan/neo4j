It is known that if the models are mis-specified, model averaging is superior to model selection. Specifically, let n be the sample size, then the worst case regret of the former decays at the rate of O(1/n) while the worst case regret of the latter decays at the rate of O(1/\u221an). In the literature, the most important and widely studied model averaging method that achieves the optimal O(1/n) average regret is the exponential weighted model averaging (EWMA) algorithm. However this method suffers from several limitations. The purpose of this paper is to present a new greedy model averaging procedure that improves EWMA. We prove strong theoretical guarantees for the new procedure and illustrate our theoretical results with empirical examples.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Rutgers University"], "authors": ["Dong Dai.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dai:Dong", "Tong Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang_0001:Tong"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2011", "pages": 9}
