Automatic detection and classification of blurred image regions are very important for different multimedia analyzing tasks. This paper presents a simple and effective automatic image blurred region detection and classification technique. In the proposed technique, blurred image regions are first detected by examining singular value information for each image pixels. The blur types (i.e. motion blur or defocus blur) are then determined based on certain alpha channel constraint that requires neither image deblurring nor blur kernel estimation. Extensive experiments have been conducted over a dataset that consists of 200 blurred image regions and 200 image regions with no blur that are extracted from 100 digital images. Experimental results show that the proposed technique detects and classifies the two types of image blurs accurately. The proposed technique can be used in many different multimedia analysis applications such as image segmentation, depth estimation and information retrieval.", "citation": "Citations (118)", "departments": ["National University of Singapore", "National University of Singapore", "Institute for I ... pore, Singapore"], "authors": ["Bolan Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Bolan", "Shijian Lu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lu:Shijian", "Chew Lim Tan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tan:Chew_Lim"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2011", "pages": 4}
