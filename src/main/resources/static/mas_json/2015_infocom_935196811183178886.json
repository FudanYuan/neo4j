In particular, we first formalize the optimal task assignment problem when workers' reputation estimates are available, as the maximization of a monotone (submodular) function subject to Matroid constraints. Then, being the optimal problem NP-hard, we propose a simple but efficient greedy heuristic task allocation algorithm. We also propose a simple \u201cmaximum a-posteriori\u201c decision rule. Finally, we test and compare different solutions, showing that system performance can greatly benefit from information about workers' reputation. Our main findings are that: i) even largely inaccurate estimates of workers' reputation can be effectively exploited in the task assignment to greatly improve system performance; ii) the performance of the maximum a-posteriori decision rule quickly degrades as worker reputation estimates become inaccurate; iii) when workers' reputation estimates are significantly inaccurate, the best performance can be obtained by combining our proposed task assignment algorithm with the LRA decision rule introduced in the literature.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Polytechnic University of Turin", "Polytechnic University of Turin", "CNR-IEIIT, Torino, Italy", "CNR-IEIIT, Torino, Italy"], "authors": ["Alberto Tarable.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tarable:Alberto", "Alessandro Nordio.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nordio:Alessandro", "Emilio Leonardi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leonardi:Emilio", "Marco Ajmone Marsan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Marsan:Marco_Ajmone"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2015", "pages": 9}
