However, most of current recommender systems suffer the following problems: (1) The large-scale and sparse data of the user-item matrix seriously affect the recommendation quality. As a result, most of the recommender systems cannot easily deal with users who have made very few ratings. (2) The traditional recommender systems assume that all the users are independent and identically distributed; this assumption ignores the connections among users, which is not consistent with the real world recommendations. Aiming at modeling recommender systems more accurately and realistically, we propose a novel probabilistic factor analysis framework, which naturally fuses the users' tastes and their trusted friends' favors together. In this framework, we coin the term Social Trust Ensemble to represent the formulation of the social trust restrictions on the recommender systems. The complexity analysis indicates that our approach can be applied to very large datasets since it scales linearly with the number of observations, while the experimental results show that our method performs better than the state-of-the-art approaches.", "citation": "Citations (664)", "departments": ["The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "The Chinese University of Hong Kong"], "authors": ["Hao Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Hao", "Irwin King.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/King:Irwin", "Michael R.
