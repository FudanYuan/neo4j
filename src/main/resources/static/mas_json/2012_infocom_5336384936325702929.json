Due to highly deployment density and the nature of the physical phenomenon, nearby sensor readings are often highly correlated in both space domain and time domain. These spatial and temporal correlations bring significant potential advantages as well as challenges for developing efficient sensing scheduling protocols for WSN. In this paper, a theoretical framework is developed to model the Quality of Monitoring (QoM) by exploiting both spatial and temporal correlations. The objective of this work is to enable the development of efficient sensing scheduling protocols which exploit these advantageous intrinsic features of the WSN paradigm. Specially, we propose two sensing scheduling schemes in order to maximize the overall QoM subject to resource constraints (e.g., under fixed duty cycle). Extensive experiments validate our theoretical results.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Illinois Institute of Technology", "Xi'an Jiaotong University"], "authors": ["Shaojie Tang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Tang:Shaojie", "Lei Yang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/y/Yang_0025:Lei"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2012", "pages": 5}
