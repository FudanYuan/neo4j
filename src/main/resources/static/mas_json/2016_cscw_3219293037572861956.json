{"title": "Effects of Sensemaking Translucence on Distributed Collaborative Analysis.", "fields": ["human computer interaction", "user experience design", "sensemaking", "crime analysis", "information sharing"], "abstract": "Collaborative sensemaking requires that analysts share their information and insights with each other, but this process of sharing runs the risks of prematurely focusing the investigation on specific suspects. To address this tension, we propose and test an interface for collaborative crime analysis that aims to make analysts more aware of their sensemaking processes. We compare our sensemaking translucence interface to a standard interface without special sensemaking features in a controlled laboratory study. We found that the sensemaking translucence interface significantly improved clue finding and crime solving performance, but that analysts rated the interface lower on subjective measures than the standard interface. We conclude that designing for distributed sensemaking requires balancing task performance vs. user experience and real-time information sharing vs. data accuracy.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "departments": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University"], "authors": ["Nitesh Goyal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goyal:Nitesh", "Susan R.
