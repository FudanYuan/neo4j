The problem to be solved in this paper is a simultaneous estimation of all mirror parameters consistent throughout multiple reflections. Unlike conventional methods utilizing a pair of direct and mirrored images of a reference 3D object to estimate the parameters on a per-mirror basis, our method renders the simultaneous estimation problem into solving a linear set of equations. The key contribution of this paper is to introduce a linear estimation of multiple mirror parameters from kaleidoscopic 2D projections of a single 3D point of unknown geometry. Evaluations with synthesized and real images demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm in comparison with conventional methods.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Kyoto University", "Kyoto University", "Kyoto University"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Kosuke Takahashi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/t/Takahashi:Kosuke", "Akihiro Miyata.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Miyata:Akihiro", "Shohei Nobuhara.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nobuhara:Shohei", "Takashi Matsuyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matsuyama:Takashi"], "pages": 9}
