{"title": "Oracle Complexity of Second-Order Methods for Finite-Sum Problems.", "fields": ["oracle", "mathematical optimization", "optimization problem", "computation", "theoretical computer science"], "abstract": "Finite-sum optimization problems are ubiquitous in machine learning, and are commonly solved using first-order methods which rely on gradient computations. Recently, there has been growing interest in \\emph{second-order} methods, which rely on both gradients and Hessians. In principle, second-order methods can require much fewer iterations than first-order methods, and hold the promise for more efficient algorithms. Although computing and manipulating Hessians is prohibitive for high-dimensional problems in general, the Hessians of individual functions in finite-sum problems can often be efficiently computed, e.g. because they possess a low-rank structure. Can second-order information indeed be used to solve such problems more efficiently? In this paper, we provide evidence that the answer -- perhaps surprisingly -- is negative, at least in terms of worst-case guarantees. However, we also discuss what additional assumptions and algorithmic approaches might potentially circumvent this negative result.", "citation": "Citations (8)", "departments": ["Weizmann Institute of Science", "Weizmann Institute of Science"], "authors": ["Yossi Arjevani.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Arjevani:Yossi", "Ohad Shamir.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shamir:Ohad"], "conf": "icml", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
