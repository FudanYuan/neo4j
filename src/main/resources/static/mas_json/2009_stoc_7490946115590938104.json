I demonstrate how this can lead to new quantum algorithms. I give an efficient implementation of a quantum curvelet transform, together with two applications: a single-shot measurement procedure for approximately finding the center of a ball in R n , given a quantum-sample over the ball; and, a quantum algorithm for finding the center of a radial function over R n , given oracle access to the function. I conjecture that these algorithms succeed with constant probability, using one quantum-sample and O(1) oracle queries, respectively, independent of the dimension n -- this can be interpreted as a quantum speed-up. To support this conjecture, I prove rigorous bounds on the distribution of probability mass for the continuous curvelet transform. This shows that the above algorithms work in an idealized \"continuous\" model.", "citation": "Citations (4)", "departments": ["California Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Yi-Kai Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yi=Kai"], "conf": "stoc", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
