We conducted experiments on decentralized IR operations on various scales of information networks and analyzed effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of various search methods. Results showed network structure, i.e., how distributed systems connect to one another, is crucial for retrieval performance. Relying on partial indexes of distributed systems, some level of network clustering enabled very efficient and effective discovery of relevant information in large scale networks. For a given network clustering level, search time was well explained by a poly-logarithmic relation to network size (i.e., the number of distributed systems), indicating a high scalability potential for searching in a growing information space. In addition, network clustering only involved local self-organization and required no global control - clustering time remained roughly constant across the various scales of networks.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "authors": ["Weimao Ke.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Ke:Weimao", "Javed Mostafa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mostafa:Javed"], "conf": "sigir", "year": "2010", "pages": 8}
