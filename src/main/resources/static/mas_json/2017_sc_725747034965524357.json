However, because of relatively high latency and low bandwidth of NVM, NVM is often paired with DRAM to build a heterogeneous memory system (HMS). As a result, data objects of the application must be carefully placed to NVM and DRAM for best performance. In this paper, we introduce a lightweight runtime solution that automatically and transparently manage data placement on HMS without the requirement of hardware modifications and disruptive change to applications. Leveraging online profiling and performance models, the runtime characterizes memory access patterns associated with data objects, and minimizes unnecessary data movement. Our runtime solution effectively bridges the performance gap between NVM and DRAM. We demonstrate that using NVM to replace the majority of DRAM can be a feasible solution for future HPC systems with the assistance of a software-based data management.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Kai Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Kai", "Yingchao Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Yingchao", "Dong Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Dong"], "pages": 14}
