Several widely-used measures such as Area Under the Curve (AUC), Average Precision (AP) and the recently proposed F W/B (Fbw) have been used to evaluate the similarity between a non-binary saliency map (SM) and a ground-truth (GT) map. These measures are based on pixel-wise errors and often ignore the structural similarities. Behavioral vision studies, however, have shown that the human visual system is highly sensitive to structures in scenes. Here, we propose a novel, efficient, and easy to calculate measure known as structural similarity measure (Structure-measure) to evaluate non-binary foreground maps. Our new measure simultaneously evaluates region-aware and object-aware structural similarity between a SM and a GT map. We demonstrate superiority of our measure over existing ones using 5 meta-measures on 5 benchmark datasets.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Nankai University", "Nankai University", "University of Central Florida", "Nankai University", "Nankai University", "University of Central Florida"], "conf": "iccv", "authors": ["Deng-Ping Fan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fan:Deng=Ping", "Ming-Ming Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Ming=Ming", "Yun Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Yun", "Tao Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Tao", "Ali Borji.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Borji:Ali"], "pages": 10}
