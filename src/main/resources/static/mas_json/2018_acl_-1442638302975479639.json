However, effective argument construction is a challenging task for both human and machines. In this work, we study a novel task on automatically generating arguments of a different stance for a given statement. We propose an encoder-decoder style neural network-based argument generation model enriched with externally retrieved evidence from Wikipedia. Our model first generates a set of talking point phrases as intermediate representation, followed by a separate decoder producing the final argument based on both input and the keyphrases. Experiments on a large-scale dataset collected from Reddit show that our model constructs arguments with more topic-relevant content than a popular sequence-to-sequence generation model according to both automatic evaluation and human assessments.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Northeastern University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Lu Wang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Lu", "Xinyu Hua.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hua:Xinyu"], "pages": 12}
