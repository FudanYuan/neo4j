{"title": "Unsupervised Dependency Parsing with Transferring Distribution via Parallel Guidance and Entropy Regularization.", "fields": ["data set", "probabilistic logic", "test data", "dependency grammar", "parsing"], "abstract": "We present a novel approach for inducing unsupervised dependency parsers for languages that have no labeled training data, but have translated text in a resourcerich language. We train probabilistic parsing models for resource-poor languages by transferring cross-lingual knowledge from resource-rich language with entropy regularization. Our method can be used as a purely monolingual dependency parser, requiring no human translations for the test data, thus making it applicable to a wide range of resource-poor languages. We perform experiments on three Data sets \u2014 Version 1.0 and version 2.0 of Google Universal Dependency Treebanks and Treebanks from CoNLL shared-tasks, across ten languages. We obtain stateof-the art performance of all the three data sets when compared with previously studied unsupervised and projected parsing systems.", "citation": "Citations (29)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["University of Washington", "University of Washington"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Xuezhe Ma.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Ma:Xuezhe", "Fei Xia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xia:Fei"], "pages": 12}
