{"title": "Picasso, Matisse, or a Fake? Automated Analysis of Drawings at the Stroke Level for Attribution and Authentication.", "fields": ["attribution", "authentication", "small number", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "This paper proposes a computational approach for analysis of strokes in line drawings by artists. We aim at developing an AI methodology that facilitates attribution of drawings of unknown authors in a way that is not easy to be deceived by forged art. The methodology used is based on quantifying the characteristics of individual strokes in drawings. We propose a novel algorithm for segmenting individual strokes. We designed and compared different hand-crafted and learned features for the task of quantifying stroke characteristics. We also propose and compare different classification methods at the drawing level. We experimented with a dataset of 300 digitized drawings with over 80 thousands strokes. The collection mainly consisted of drawings of Pablo Picasso, Henry Matisse, and Egon Schiele, besides a small number of representative works of other artists. The experiments shows that the proposed methodology can classify individual strokes with accuracy 70%-90%, and aggregate over drawings with accuracy above 80%, while being robust to be deceived by fakes (with accuracy 100% for detecting fakes in most settings).", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Rutgers University"], "authors": ["Ahmed Elgammal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elgammal:Ahmed", "Yan Kang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kang:Yan", "Milko Den Leeuw.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Leeuw:Milko_Den"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 9}
