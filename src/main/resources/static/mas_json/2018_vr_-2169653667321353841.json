But it is still challenging to estimate accurate 3D pose from consumer imaging devices such as depth camera. This paper presents a novel cascaded 3D full-body pose regression method to estimate accurate pose from a single depth image at 100 fps. The key idea is to train cascaded regressors based on Gradient Boosting algorithm from pre-recorded human motion capture database. By incorporating hierarchical kinematics model of human pose into the learning procedure, we can directly estimate accurate 3D joint angles instead of joint positions. The biggest advantage of this model is that the bone length can be preserved during the whole 3D pose estimation procedure, which leads to more effective features and higher pose estimation accuracy. Our method can be used as an initialization procedure when combining with tracking methods. We demonstrate the power of our method on a wide range of synthesized human motion data from CMU mocap database, Human3.6M dataset and real human movements data captured in real time. In our comparison against previous 3D pose estimation methods and commercial system such as Kinect 2017, we achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Civil Aviation University of China", "CAS, Institute  ... ting Technology"], "authors": ["Shihong Xia.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xia:Shihong", "Zihao Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Zihao", "Le Su.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Su:Le"], "conf": "vr", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
