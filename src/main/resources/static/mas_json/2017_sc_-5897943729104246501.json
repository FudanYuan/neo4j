In this paper, using the daily file system metadata snapshots collected over 500 days, we have studied the behavioral trends of 1, 362 active users and 380 projects across 35 science domains. In particular, we have analyzed both individual and collective behavior of users and projects, highlighting needs from individual communities and the overall requirements to operate the file system. We have analyzed the metadata across three dimensions, namely (i) the projects' file generation and usage trends, using quantitative file system-centric metrics, (ii) scientific user behavior on the file system, and (iii) the data sharing trends of users and projects. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first of its kind to provide comprehensive insights on user behavior from multiple science domains through metadata analysis of a large-scale shared file system. We envision that this OLCF case study will provide valuable insights for the design, operation, and management of storage systems at scale, and also encourage other HPC centers to undertake similar such efforts.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Oak Ridge National Laboratory", "Oak Ridge National Laboratory", "Oak Ridge National Laboratory", "Oak Ridge National Laboratory"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Seung-Hwan Lim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lim:Seung=Hwan", "Hyogi Sim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sim:Hyogi", "Raghul Gunasekaran.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gunasekaran:Raghul", "Sudharshan S.
