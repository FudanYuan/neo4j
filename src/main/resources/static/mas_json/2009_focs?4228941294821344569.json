{"title": "An Oblivious O(1)-Approximation for Single Source Buy-at-Bulk.", "fields": ["polynomial", "approximation algorithm", "ellipsoid method", "steiner tree problem", "approximation theory"], "abstract": "We consider the single-source (or single-sink) buy-at-bulk problem with an unknown concave cost function. We want to route a set of demands along a graph to or from a designated root node, and the cost of routing x units of flow along an edge is proportional to some concave, non-decreasing function f such that f(0) = 0. We present a polynomial time algorithm that finds a distribution over trees such that the expected cost of a tree for any f is within an O(1)-factor of the optimum cost for that f. The previous best simultaneous approximation for this problem, even ignoring computation time, was O(log |D|), where D is the multi-set of demand nodes. We design a simple algorithmic framework using the ellipsoid method that finds an O(1)-approximation if one exists, and then construct a separation oracle using a novel adaptation of the Guha, Meyerson, and Munagala[GMM01] algorithm for the single-sink buy-at-bulk problem that proves an O(1) approximation is possible for all f. The number of trees in the support of the distribution constructed by our algorithm is at most 1+log |D|.", "citation": "Citations (9)", "departments": ["Stanford University", "Stanford University"], "authors": ["Ashish Goel.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Goel:Ashish", "Ian Post.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Post:Ian"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2009", "pages": 9}
