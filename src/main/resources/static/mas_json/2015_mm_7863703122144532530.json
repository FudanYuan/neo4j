{"title": "Captioning Images Using Different Styles.", "fields": ["computer vision", "closed captioning", "multimedia", "visual objects", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "I develop techniques that can be used to incorporate stylistic objectives into existing image captioning systems. Style is generally a very tricky concept to define, thus I concentrate on two specific components of style. First I develop a technique for predicting how people will name visual objects. I demonstrate that this technique could be used to generate captions with human like naming conventions. Full details are available in a recent publication. Second I outline a system for generating sentences which express a strong positive or negative sentiment. Finally I present two possible future directions which are aimed at modelling style more generally. These are learning to imitate an individuals captioning style and generating a diverse set of captions for a single image.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "departments": ["Australian National University"], "authors": ["Alexander Patrick Mathews.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mathews:Alexander_Patrick"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2015", "pages": 4}
