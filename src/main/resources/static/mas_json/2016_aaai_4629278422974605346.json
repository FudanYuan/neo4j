In our approach, we interpret the Viterbi algorithm as a repeated computation of matrix-vector (max, +)-multiplications. On time-homogeneous HMMs, this computation is online: a matrix, known in advance, has to be multiplied with several vectors revealed one at a time. Our main contribution is an algorithm solving this version of matrix-vector (max, +)-multiplication in subquadratic time, by performing a polynomial preprocessing of the matrix. Employing this fast multiplication algorithm, we solve the MAPD problem in O(mn2/log n) time for any time-homogeneous HMM of size n and observation sequence of length m, with an extra polynomial preprocessing cost negligible for m > n. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm for the MAPD problem requiring subquadratic time per observation, under the assumption \u2013 usually verified in practice \u2013 that the transition probability matrix does not change with time.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Trento", "Polytechnic University of Milan", "University of Verona"], "authors": ["Massimo Cairo.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cairo:Massimo", "Gabriele Farina.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Farina:Gabriele", "Romeo Rizzi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rizzi:Romeo"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2016", "pages": 7}
