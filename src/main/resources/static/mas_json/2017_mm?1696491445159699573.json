Computer vision and social network analysis research have also focused on understanding the impact of content and information diffusion in making content viral, with prior approaches not performing significantly well as other traditional classification tasks. In this paper, we present a novel pairwise reformulation of the virality prediction problem as an attribute prediction task and develop a novel algorithm to model image virality on online media using a pairwise neural network. Our model provides significant insights into the features that are responsible for promoting virality and surpasses the existing state-of-the-art by a 12% average improvement in prediction. We also investigate the effect of external category supervision on relative attribute prediction and observe an increase in prediction accuracy for the same across several attribute learning datasets.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Indian Institute of Technology Delhi"], "authors": ["Abhimanyu Dubey.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dubey:Abhimanyu", "Sumeet Agarwal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agarwal:Sumeet"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
