{"title": "SymNet: Scalable symbolic execution for modern networks.", "fields": ["network packet", "stateful firewall", "forwarding plane", "symbolic execution", "header"], "abstract": "We present SymNet, a network static analysis tool based on symbolic execution. SymNet injects symbolic packets and tracks their evolution through the network. Our key novelty is SEFL, a language we designed for expressing data plane processing in a symbolic-execution friendly manner. SymNet statically analyzes an abstract data plane model that consists of the SEFL code for every node and the links between nodes. SymNet can check networks containing routers with hundreds of thousands of prefixes and NATs in seconds, while verifying packet header memory-safety and covering network functionality such as dynamic tunneling, stateful processing and encryption. We used SymNet to debug mid- dlebox interactions from the literature, to check properties of our department\u2019s network and the Stanford backbone. Modeling network functionality is not easy. To aid users we have developed parsers that automatically generate SEFL models from router and switch tables, firewall configura- tions and arbitrary Click modular router configurations. The parsers rely on prebuilt models that are exact and fast to an- alyze. Finally, we have built an automated testing tool that combines symbolic execution and testing to check whether the model is an accurate representation of the real code.", "citation": "Citations (19)", "departments": ["Politehnica University of Bucharest", "Politehnica University of Bucharest", "Politehnica University of Bucharest", "Politehnica University of Bucharest"], "authors": ["Radu Stoenescu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stoenescu:Radu", "Matei Popovici.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Popovici:Matei", "Lorina Negreanu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Negreanu:Lorina", "Costin Raiciu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Raiciu:Costin"], "conf": "sigcomm", "year": "2016", "pages": 14}
