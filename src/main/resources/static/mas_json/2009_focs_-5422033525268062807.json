We show how to sample from a distribution that is within a multiplicative $(1+\\delta)$ of uniform in expected time $\\TO(m\\sqrt{n}\\log 1/\\delta)$. This improves the sparse graph case of the best previously known worst-case bound of $O(\\min \\{mn, n^{2.376}\\})$, which has stood for twenty years. To achieve this goal, we exploit the connection between random walks on graphs and electrical networks, and we use this to introduce a new approach to the problem that integrates discrete random walk-based techniques with continuous linear algebraic methods. We believe that our use of electrical networks and sparse linear system solvers in conjunction with random walks and combinatorial partitioning techniques is a useful paradigm that will find further applications in algorithmic graph theory.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Jonathan A.
