Recently, Thompson sampling (TS), a randomized algorithm with a Bayesian spirit, has attracted much attention for its empirically excellent performance, and it is revealed to have an optimal regret bound in the standard single-play MAB problem. In this paper, we propose the multiple-play Thompson sampling (MP-TS) algorithm, an extension of TS to the multiple-play MAB problem, and discuss its regret analysis. We prove that MP-TS for binary rewards has the optimal regret upper bound that matches the regret lower bound provided by Anantharam et al. (1987). Therefore, MP-TS is the first computationally efficient algorithm with optimal regret. A set of computer simulations was also conducted, which compared MP-TS with state-of-the-art algorithms. We also propose a modification of MP-TS, which is shown to have better empirical performance.", "citation": "Citations (20)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo", "University of Tokyo"], "conf": "icml", "authors": ["Junpei Komiyama.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Komiyama:Junpei", "Junya Honda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Honda:Junya", "Hiroshi Nakagawa.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nakagawa:Hiroshi"], "pages": 10}
