Furthermore, our lower bound holds for nearly the full range of $\\varepsilon$ of interest, since there is always an isometric embedding into dimension $\\min\\{d, n\\}$ (either the identity map, or projection onto $\\mathop{span}(X)$). \nPreviously such a lower bound was only known to hold against linear maps $f$, and not for such a wide range of parameters $\\varepsilon, n, d$ [LN16]. The best previously known lower bound for general $f$ was $m = \\Omega(\\varepsilon^{-2}\\lg n/\\lg(1/\\varepsilon))$ [Wel74, Lev83, Alo03], which is suboptimal for any $\\varepsilon = o(1)$.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Aarhus University", "Harvard University"], "authors": ["Kasper Green Larsen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Larsen:Kasper_Green", "Jelani Nelson.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/n/Nelson:Jelani"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2017", "pages": 6}
