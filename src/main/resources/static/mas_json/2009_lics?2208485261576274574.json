{"title": "A Note on the Complexity of the Satisfiability Problem for Graded Modal Logics.", "fields": ["accessibility relation", "normal modal logic", "strict conditional", "s5", "modal \u03bc calculus"], "abstract": "Graded modal logic is the formal language obtained from ordinary modal logic by endowing its modal operators with cardinality constraints. Under the familiar possible-worlds semantics, these augmented modal operators receive interpretations such as \"It is true at no fewer than 15 accessible worlds that...\", or \"It is true at no more than 2 accessible worlds that...\". We investigate the complexity of satisfiability for this language over some familiar classes of frames. This problem is more challenging than its ordinary modal logic counterpart---especially in the case of transitive frames, where graded modal logic lacks the tree-model property. We obtain tight complexity bounds for the problem of determining the satisfiability of a given graded modal logic formula over the classes of frames characterized by any combination of reflexivity, seriality, symmetry, transitivity and the Euclidean property.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["University of Oxford", "University of Manchester"], "authors": ["Yevgeny Kazakov.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kazakov:Yevgeny", "Ian Pratt-Hartmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Pratt=Hartmann:Ian"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2009", "pages": 10}
