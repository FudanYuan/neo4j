{"title": "Reflective Practicum: A Framework of Sensitising Concepts to Design for Transformative Reflection.", "fields": ["transformative learning", "trait", "scaffold", "social emotional learning", "practicum"], "abstract": "Designing for reflection is becoming an increasingly important part of many HCI systems in a wide range of application domains. However, there is a gap in our understanding of how the process of reflection can be supported through technology. In fact, an implicit assumption in the majority of existing work is that, just by providing access to well-selected data, in-depth reflection can and will occur. To counter this view, we draw on Schon's notion of reflective practicum and apply it as a sensitising concept to identify the complex interplay of factors that support transformative reflection in the context of two social-emotional learning (SEL) studies. The results highlight the need to carefully scaffold the process of reflection, rather than simply assume that the capability to reflect is a broadly available trait to be 'triggered' through data. Building on this analysis, we develop a conceptual framework that extends the concept of the reflective practicum towards identifying appropriate roles of technology to support transformative reflection. While our case is within the context of SEL, we argue that a deeper understanding of these opportunities can also benefit designing for reflection in other areas.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology", "Vienna University of Technology"], "conf": "chi", "authors": ["Petr Slov\u00e1k.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Slov=aacute=k:Petr", "Christopher Frauenberger.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Frauenberger:Christopher", "Geraldine Fitzpatrick.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Fitzpatrick:Geraldine"], "pages": 12}
