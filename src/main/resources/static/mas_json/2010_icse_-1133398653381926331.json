Because the typestate-analysis problem is statically undecidable, researchers have proposed a hybrid approach that uses residual monitors to signal property violations at runtime.   We present an efficient novel static typestate analysis that is flow-sensitive, partially context-sensitive, and that generates residual runtime monitors. To gain efficiency, our analysis uses precise, flow-sensitive information on an intra-procedural level only, and models the remainder of the program using a flow-insensitive pointer abstraction. Unlike previous flow-sensitive analyses, our analysis uses an additional backward analysis to partition states into equivalence classes. Code locations that transition between equivalent states are irrelevant and require no monitoring. As we show in this work, this notion of equivalent states is crucial to obtaining sound runtime monitors.   We proved our analysis correct, implemented the analysis in the Clara framework for typestate analysis, and applied it to the DaCapo benchmark suite. In half of the cases, our analysis determined exactly the property-violating program points. In many other cases, the analysis reduced the number of instrumentation points by large amounts, yielding significant speed-ups during runtime monitoring.", "citation": "Citations (73)", "departments": ["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"], "authors": ["Eric Bodden.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bodden:Eric"], "conf": "icse", "year": "2010", "pages": 10}
