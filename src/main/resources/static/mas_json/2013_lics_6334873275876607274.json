This well-known result, shown by Rabin and Scott and independently by Shepherd son, states that two-way finite state automata (even non-deterministic) characterize the class of regular languages. It is also known that this result does not extend to finite string transductions: (deterministic) two-way finite state transducers strictly extend the expressive power of (functional) one-way transducers. In particular deterministic two-way transducers capture exactly the class of MSO-transductions of finite strings. In this paper, we address the following definability problem: given a function defined by a two-way finite state transducer, is it definable by a one-way finite state transducer? By extending Rabin and Scott's proof to transductions, we show that this problem is decidable. Our procedure builds a one-way transducer, which is equivalent to the two-way transducer, whenever one exists.", "citation": "Citations (13)", "departments": ["University of Paris", "University of Bordeaux", "Aix-Marseille University", "University of Hasselt"], "authors": ["Emmanuel Filiot.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Filiot:Emmanuel", "Olivier Gauwin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gauwin:Olivier", "Pierre-Alain Reynier.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Reynier:Pierre=Alain", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Servais.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Servais:Fr=eacute=d=eacute=ric"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2013", "pages": 10}
