These specifications are expressed in a linear temporal logic (LTL) extended with non-linear arithmetic constraints and timing constraints on signals. G4LTL-ST generates code in IEC 61131-3-compatible Structured Text, which is compiled into executable code for a large number of industrial field-level devices. The synthesis algorithm of G4LTL-ST implements pseudo-Boolean abstraction of data constraints and the compilation of timing constraints into LTL, together with a counterstrategy-guided abstraction-refinement synthesis loop. Since temporal logic specifications are notoriously difficult to use in practice, G4LTL-ST supports engineers in specifying realizable control problems by suggesting suitable restrictions on the behavior of the control environment from failed synthesis attempts.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Ladenburg Thalmann", "National Taiwan University", "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "Ladenburg Thalmann"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Chih-Hong Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Chih=Hong", "Chung-Hao Huang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huang:Chung=Hao", "Harald Ruess.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ruess:Harald", "Stefan Stattelmann.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Stattelmann:Stefan"], "pages": 9}
