{"title": "Single Shot Temporal Action Detection.", "fields": ["thumos", "network architecture", "pattern recognition", "computer vision", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Temporal action detection is a very important yet challenging problem, since videos in real applications are usually long, untrimmed and contain multiple action instances. This problem requires not only recognizing action categories but also detecting start time and end time of each action instance. Many state-of-the-art methods adopt the \"detection by classification\" framework: first do proposal, and then classify proposals. The main drawback of this framework is that the boundaries of action instance proposals have been fixed during the classification step. To address this issue, we propose a novel Single Shot Action Detector (SSAD) network based on 1D temporal convolutional layers to skip the proposal generation step via directly detecting action instances in untrimmed video. On pursuit of designing a particular SSAD network that can work effectively for temporal action detection, we empirically search for the best network architecture of SSAD due to lacking existing models that can be directly adopted. Moreover, we investigate into input feature types and fusion strategies to further improve detection accuracy. We conduct extensive experiments on two challenging datasets: THUMOS 2014 and MEXaction2. When setting Intersection-over-Union threshold to 0.5 during evaluation, SSAD significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art systems by increasing mAP from $19.0%$ to $24.6%$ on THUMOS 2014 and from 7.4% to $11.0%$ on MEXaction2.", "citation": "Citations (14)", "departments": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "Columbia University"], "authors": ["Tianwei Lin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Lin:Tianwei", "Xu Zhao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhao:Xu", "Zheng Shou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shou:Zheng"], "conf": "mm", "year": "2017", "pages": 9}
