Prior work has evaluated this intriguing result using a word analogy prediction formulation and hand-selected relations, but the generality of the finding over a broader range of lexical relation types and different learning settings has not been evaluated. In this paper, we carry out such an evaluation in two learning settings: (1) spectral clustering to induce word relations, and (2) supervised learning to classify vector differences into relation types. We find that word embeddings capture a surprising amount of information, and that, under suitable supervised training, vector subtraction generalises well to a broad range of relations, including over unseen lexical items.", "citation": "Citations (32)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["University of Cambridge", "University of Melbourne", "University of Melbourne"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Ekaterina Vylomova.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/v/Vylomova:Ekaterina", "Laura Rimell.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rimell:Laura", "Trevor Cohn.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cohn:Trevor", "Timothy Baldwin.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Baldwin:Timothy"], "pages": -1}
