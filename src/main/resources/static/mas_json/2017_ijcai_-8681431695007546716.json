{"title": "A Causal Framework for Discovering and Removing Direct and Indirect Discrimination.", "fields": ["causal structure", "computer science", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Anti-discrimination is an increasingly important task in data science. In this paper, we investigate the problem of discovering both direct and indirect discrimination from the historical data, and removing the discriminatory effects before the data is used for predictive analysis (e.g., building classifiers). We make use of the causal network to capture the causal structure of the data. Then we model direct and indirect discrimination as the path-specific effects, which explicitly distinguish the two types of discrimination as the causal effects transmitted along different paths in the network. Based on that, we propose an effective algorithm for discovering direct and indirect discrimination, as well as an algorithm for precisely removing both types of discrimination while retaining good data utility. Different from previous works, our approaches can ensure that the predictive models built from the modified data will not incur discrimination in decision making. Experiments using real datasets show the effectiveness of our approaches.", "citation": "Citations (3)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of Arkansas", "University of Arkansas", "University of Arkansas"], "conf": "ijcai", "authors": ["Lu Zhang.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhang:Lu", "Yongkai Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Yongkai", "Xintao Wu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wu:Xintao"], "pages": 7}
