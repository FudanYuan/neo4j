A key result of this paper is that contrary to the conventional wireless networks, in wireless sensor networks, longer packets reduce the collision probability. Consequently, an optimization solution is formalized by using three different objective functions, i.e., packet throughput, energy consumption, and resource utilization. Furthermore, the effects of end-to-end latency and reliability constraints are investigated that may be required by a particular application. As a result, a generic, cross-layer optimization framework is developed to determine the optimal packet size in WSN. This framework is further extended to determine the optimal packet size in underwater and underground sensor networks. From this framework, the optimal packet sizes under various network parameters are determined.", "citation": "Citations (154)", "departments": ["University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln", "Georgia Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Mehmet C.
