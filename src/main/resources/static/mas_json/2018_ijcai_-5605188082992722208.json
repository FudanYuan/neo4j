This framework enriches the tasks currently supported in computational social choice with relational database context, thus making it possible to formulate sophisticated queries about voting rules, candidates, voters, issues, and positions. At the conceptual level, we give rigorous semantics to queries in this framework by introducing the notions of necessary answers and possible answers to queries. At the technical level, we embark on an investigation of the computational complexity of the necessary answers. We establish a number of results about the complexity of the necessary answers of conjunctive queries involving positional scoring rules that contrast sharply with earlier results about the complexity of the necessary winners.", "citation": "Not cited", "departments": ["Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology", "University of California, Santa Cruz", "IBM", "Drexel University"], "authors": ["Benny Kimelfeld.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kimelfeld:Benny", "Phokion G.
