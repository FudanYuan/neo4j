Existing approaches have concentrated on either designing the best feature representation or learning optimal matching metrics in a static setting where the number of cameras are fixed in a network. Most approaches have neglected the dynamic and open world nature of the re-identification problem, where a new camera may be temporarily inserted into an existing system to get additional information. To address such a novel and very practical problem, we propose an unsupervised adaptation scheme for re-identification models in a dynamic camera network. First, we formulate a domain perceptive re-identification method based on geodesic flow kernel that can effectively find the best source camera (already installed) to adapt with a newly introduced target camera, without requiring a very expensive training phase. Second, we introduce a transitive inference algorithm for re-identification that can exploit the information from best source camera to improve the accuracy across other camera pairs in a network of multiple cameras. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised learning based alternatives whilst being extremely efficient to compute.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2017", "departments": ["University of California, Riverside", "Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia", "Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia", "University of California, Riverside"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Rameswar Panda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Panda:Rameswar", "Amran Bhuiyan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bhuiyan:Amran", "Vittorio Murino.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Murino:Vittorio", "Amit K.
