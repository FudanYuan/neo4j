Although backpressure is conceptually viewed as layered, the decisions of routing and scheduling are made jointly, which imposes several challenges in practice. In this work, we present Diff-Max, an approach that separates routing and scheduling and has three strengths: (i) Diff-Max improves throughput significantly, (ii) the separation of routing and scheduling makes practical implementation easier by minimizing cross-layer operations; i.e., routing is implemented in the network layer and scheduling is implemented in the link layer, and (iii) the separation of routing and scheduling leads to modularity; i.e., routing and scheduling are independent modules in Diff-Max, and one can continue to operate even if the other does not. Our approach is grounded in a network utility maximization (NUM) formulation and its solution. Based on the structure of Diff-Max, we propose two practical schemes: Diff-subMax and wDiff-subMax. We demonstrate the benefits of our schemes through simulation in ns-2.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "departments": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Hulya Seferoglu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Seferoglu:Hulya", "Eytan Modiano.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Modiano:Eytan"], "conf": "infocom", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
