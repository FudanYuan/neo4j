{"title": "PAM: parallel augmented maps.", "fields": ["interval tree", "ranking", "execution model", "range query", "ranging"], "abstract": "Ordered (key-value) maps are an important and widely-used data type for large-scale data processing frameworks. Beyond simple search, insertion and deletion, more advanced operations such as range extraction, filtering, and bulk updates form a critical part of these frameworks.   We describe an interface for ordered maps that is augmented to support fast range queries and sums, and introduce a parallel and concurrent library called PAM (Parallel Augmented Maps) that implements the interface. The interface includes a wide variety of functions on augmented maps ranging from basic insertion and deletion to more interesting functions such as union, intersection, filtering, extracting ranges, splitting, and range-sums. We describe algorithms for these functions that are efficient both in theory and practice.   As examples of the use of the interface and the performance of PAM we apply the library to four applications: simple range sums, interval trees, 2D range trees, and ranked word index searching. The interface greatly simplifies the implementation of these data structures over direct implementations. Sequentially the code achieves performance that matches or exceeds existing libraries designed specially for a single application, and in parallel our implementation gets speedups ranging from 40 to 90 on 72 cores with 2-way hyperthreading.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "ppopp", "authors": ["Yihan Sun.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sun_0001:Yihan", "Daniel Ferizovic.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/f/Ferizovic:Daniel", "Guy E.
