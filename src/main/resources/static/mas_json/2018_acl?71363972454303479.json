{"title": "AdvEntuRe: Adversarial Training for Textual Entailment with Knowledge-Guided Examples.", "fields": ["discriminator", "logical consequence", "adventure", "textual entailment", "adversarial system"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of learning textual entailment models with limited supervision (5K-10K training examples), and present two complementary approaches for it. First, we propose knowledge-guided adversarial example generators for incorporating large lexical resources in entailment models via only a handful of rule templates. Second, to make the entailment model - a discriminator - more robust, we propose the first GAN-style approach for training it using a natural language example generator that iteratively adjusts based on the discriminator's performance. We demonstrate effectiveness using two entailment datasets, where the proposed methods increase accuracy by 4.7% on SciTail and by 2.8% on a 1% training sub-sample of SNLI. Notably, even a single hand-written rule, negate, improves the accuracy on the negation examples in SNLI by 6.1%.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["KAIST", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "IBM", "Carnegie Mellon University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Eduard H.
