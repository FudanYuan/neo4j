In this paper, we describe three use cases in which SGNMT is currently playing an active role: (1) teaching as SGNMT is being used for course work and student theses in the MPhil in Machine Learning, Speech and Language Technology at the University of Cambridge, (2) research as most of the research work of the Cambridge MT group is based on SGNMT, and (3) technology transfer as we show how SGNMT is helping to transfer research findings from the laboratory to the industry, eg. into a product of SDL plc.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Johns Hopkins University", "Johns Hopkins University"], "conf": "acl", "authors": ["Benjamin Van Durme.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Durme:Benjamin_Van", "Keisuke Sakaguchi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sakaguchi:Keisuke"], "pages": 11}
