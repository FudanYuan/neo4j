Our model embeds object and action concepts as well as other available modalities from videos into a distributional semantic space. To our knowledge, this is the first Zero-Shot event detection model that is built on top of distributional semantics and extends it in the following directions: (a) semantic embedding of multimodal information in videos (with focus on the visual modalities), (b) automatically determining relevance of concepts/attributes to a free text query, which could be useful for other applications, and (c) retrieving videos by free text event query (e.g., \"changing a vehicle tire\") based on their content. We embed videos into a distributional semantic space and then measure the similarity between videos and the event query in a free text form. We validated our method on the large TRECVID MED (Multimedia Event Detection) challenge. Using only the event title as a query, our method outperformed the state-of-the-art that uses big descriptions from 12.6% to 13.5% with MAP metric and 0.73 to 0.83 with ROC-AUC metric. It is also an order of magnitude faster.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "Rutgers University", "SRI International"], "authors": ["Mohamed Elhoseiny.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Elhoseiny:Mohamed", "Jingen Liu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liu:Jingen", "Hui Cheng.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cheng:Hui", "Harpreet S.
