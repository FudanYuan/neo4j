{"title": "Double or Nothing: Multiplicative Incentive Mechanisms for Crowdsourcing.", "fields": ["popularity", "crowdsourcing", "labeled data", "nothing", "multiplicative function", "payment"], "abstract": "Crowdsourcing has gained immense popularity in machine learning applications for obtaining large amounts of labeled data. Crowdsourcing is cheap and fast, but suffers from the problem of low-quality data. To address this fundamental challenge in crowdsourcing, we propose a simple payment mechanism to incentivize workers to answer only the questions that they are sure of and skip the rest. We show that surprisingly, under a mild and natural \"no-free-lunch\" requirement, this mechanism is the one and only incentive-compatible payment mechanism possible. We also show that among all possible incentive-compatible mechanisms (that may or may not satisfy no-free-lunch), our mechanism makes the smallest possible payment to spammers. We further extend our results to a more general setting in which workers are required to provide a quantized confidence for each question. Interestingly, this unique mechanism takes a \"multiplicative\" form. The simplicity of the mechanism is an added benefit. In preliminary experiments involving over 900 worker-task pairs, we observe a significant drop in the error rates under this unique mechanism for the same or lower monetary expenditure.", "citation": "Citations (26)", "year": "2015", "departments": ["University of California, Berkeley", "Microsoft", "University of California, Berkeley", "Microsoft"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Nihar Bhadresh Shah.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shah:Nihar_Bhadresh", "Denny Zhou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhou:Denny"], "pages": 9}
