{"title": "Inapproximability for Metric Embeddings into R^d.", "fields": ["random projection", "metric space", "embedding", "linear subspace", "approximation algorithm"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of computing the smallest possible distortion for embedding of a given n-point metric space into R.d, where d is fixed (and small). For d = 1, it was known that approximating the minimum distortion with a factor better than roughly n 1/12  is NP-hard. From this result we derive inapproximability with factor roughly n 1/(22d-10)  for every fixed d ges 2, by a conceptually very simple reduction. However, the proof of correctness involves a nontrivial result in geometric topology (whose current proof is based on ideas due to Jussi Vaisala). For d ges 3,we obtain a stronger inapproximability result by a different reduction: assuming PneNP, no polynomial- time algorithm can distinguish between spaces embeddable in R.d with constant distortion from spaces requiring distortion at least n c/d , for a constant c > 0. The exponent c/d has the correct order of magnitude, since every n-point metric space can be embedded in R d  with distortion O(n 2/d  log 3/2  n) and such an embedding can be constructed in polynomial time by random projection. For d = 2, we give an example of a metric space that requires a large distortion for embedding in R 2 , while all not too large subspaces of it embed almost isometrically.", "citation": "Citations (6)", "departments": ["Charles University in Prague", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "authors": ["Jir\u00ed Matousek.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Matousek:Jir=iacute=", "Anastasios Sidiropoulos.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Sidiropoulos:Anastasios"], "conf": "focs", "year": "2008", "pages": 9}
