{"title": "AIVAT: A New Variance Reduction Technique for Agent Evaluation in Imperfect Information Games.", "fields": ["variance reduction", "heuristic", "perfect information", "estimator", "monte carlo method"], "abstract": "Evaluating agent performance when outcomes are stochastic and agents use randomized strategies can be challenging when there is limited data available. The variance of sampled outcomes may make the simple approach of Monte Carlo sampling inadequate. This is the case for agents playing heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em poker, where man-machine competitions have involved multiple days of consistent play and still not resulted in statistically significant conclusions even when the winner's margin is substantial. In this paper, we introduce AIVAT, a low variance, provably unbiased value assessment tool that uses an arbitrary heuristic estimate of state value, as well as the explicit strategy of a subset of the agents. Unlike existing techniques which reduce the variance from chance events, or only consider game ending actions, AIVAT reduces the variance both from choices by nature and by players with a known strategy. The resulting estimator in no-limit poker can reduce the number of hands needed to draw statistical conclusions by more than a factor of 10.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Alberta", "Charles University in Prague", "Charles University in Prague", "University of Alberta"], "authors": ["Neil Burch.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Burch:Neil", "Martin Schmid.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmid:Martin", "Matej Moravcik.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Moravcik:Matej", "Dustin Morrill.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Morrill:Dustin", "Michael Bowling.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/b/Bowling:Michael"], "conf": "aaai", "year": "2018", "pages": 8}
