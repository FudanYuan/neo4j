Existing methods for the computation of multiple clusters, corresponding to a balanced k-cut of the graph, are either based on greedy techniques or heuristics which have weak connection to the original motivation of minimizing the normalized cut. In this paper we propose a new tight continuous relaxation for any balanced k-cut problem and show that a related recently proposed relaxation is in most cases loose leading to poor performance in practice. For the optimization of our tight continuous relaxation we propose a new algorithm for the difficult sum-of-ratios minimization problem which achieves monotonic descent. Extensive comparisons show that our method outperforms all existing approaches for ratio cut and other balanced k-cut criteria.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2014", "departments": ["Saarland University", "Saarland University", "Saarland University"], "conf": "nips", "authors": ["Syama Sundar Rangapuram.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rangapuram:Syama_Sundar", "Pramod Kaushik Mudrakarta.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Mudrakarta:Pramod_Kaushik", "Matthias Hein.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hein_0001:Matthias"], "pages": 9}
