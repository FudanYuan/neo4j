{"title": "Dirichlet Process with Mixed Random Measures: A Nonparametric Topic Model for Labeled Data.", "fields": ["nonparametric statistics", "labeled data", "dirichlet process", "topic model", "random measure"], "abstract": "We describe a nonparametric topic model for labeled data. The model uses a mixture of random measures (MRM) as a base distribution of the Dirichlet process (DP) of the HDP framework, so we call it the DP-MRM. To model labeled data, we define a DP distributed random measure for each label, and the resulting model generates an unbounded number of topics for each label. We apply DP-MRM on single-labeled and multi-labeled corpora of documents and compare the performance on label prediction with MedLDA, LDA-SVM, and Labeled-LDA. We further enhance the model by incorporating ddCRP and modeling multi-labeled images for image segmentation and object labeling, comparing the performance with nCuts and rddCRP.", "citation": "Citations (12)", "departments": ["KAIST", "KAIST", "KAIST"], "authors": ["Dongwoo Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Dongwoo", "Suin Kim.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/k/Kim:Suin", "Alice H.
