Our goal for this class of applications is to optimize a user-specified benefit function while meeting the time deadline. Our first contribution in this paper is a multi-objective optimization algorithm for scheduling the application onto the most efficient and reliable resources. In this way, the processing can achieve the maximum benefit while also maximizing the success-rate, which is the probability of finishing execution without failures. However, for the cases where failures do occur, we have developed a hybrid failure recovery scheme to ensure that the application can complete within the pre-specified time interval. Our experimental results show that our scheduling algorithm can achieve better benefit when compared to several heuristics-based greedy scheduling algorithms, while still having a negligible overhead. Benefit is further improved when we apply the hybrid failure recovery scheme, and the success-rate becomes 100%.", "citation": "Citations (2)", "year": "2009", "departments": ["Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University", "Ohio State University"], "conf": "sc", "authors": ["Qian Zhu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/z/Zhu:Qian", "Gagan Agrawal.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Agrawal:Gagan"], "pages": -1}
