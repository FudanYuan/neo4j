{"title": "Few-Shot Adaptation for Multimedia Semantic Indexing.", "fields": ["search engine indexing", "computer vision", "trecvid", "estimation theory", "information retrieval"], "abstract": "We propose a few-shot adaptation framework, which bridges zero-shot learning and supervised many-shot learning, for semantic indexing of image and video data. Few-shot adaptation provides robust parameter estimation with few training examples, by optimizing the parameters of zero-shot learning and supervised many-shot learning simultaneously. In this method, first we build a zero-shot detector, and then update it by using the few examples. Our experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed framework on three datasets: TRECVID Semantic Indexing 2010, 2014, and ImageNET. On the ImageNET dataset, we show that our method outperforms recent few-shot learning methods. On the TRECVID 2014 dataset, we achieve 15.19% and 35.98% in Mean Average Precision under the zero-shot condition and the supervised condition, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, these are the best results on this dataset.", "citation": "Not cited", "year": "2018", "departments": ["Tokyo Institute of Technology", "Tokyo Institute of Technology"], "conf": "mm", "authors": ["Nakamasa Inoue.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/i/Inoue:Nakamasa", "Koichi Shinoda.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shinoda:Koichi"], "pages": 9}
