{"title": "Bottom-Up and Top-Down Reasoning with Hierarchical Rectified Gaussians.", "fields": ["probabilistic logic", "gaussian network model", "rectifier", "recurrent neural network", "latent variable"], "abstract": "Convolutional neural nets (CNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in recent history. Such approaches tend to work in a \"unidirectional\" bottom-up feed-forward fashion. However, practical experience and biological evidence tells us that feedback plays a crucial role, particularly for detailed spatial understanding tasks. This work explores \"bidirectional\" architectures that also reason with top-down feedback: neural units are influenced by both lower and higher-level units. We do so by treating units as rectified latent variables in a quadratic energy function, which can be seen as a hierarchical Rectified Gaussian model (RGs) [39]. We show that RGs can be optimized with a quadratic program (QP), that can in turn be optimized with a recurrent neural network (with rectified linear units). This allows RGs to be trained with GPU-optimized gradient descent. From a theoretical perspective, RGs help establish a connection between CNNs and hierarchical probabilistic models. From a practical perspective, RGs are well suited for detailed spatial tasks that can benefit from top-down reasoning. We illustrate them on the challenging task of keypoint localization under occlusions, where local bottom-up evidence may be misleading. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks.", "citation": "Citations (18)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "University of California, Irvine"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Peiyun Hu.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Hu:Peiyun", "Deva Ramanan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Ramanan:Deva"], "pages": 10}
