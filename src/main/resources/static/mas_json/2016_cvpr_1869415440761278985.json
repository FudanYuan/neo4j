The generative MRF acts on higher-levels of a dCNN feature pyramid, controling the image layout at an abstract level. We apply the method to both photographic and non-photo-realistic (artwork) synthesis tasks. The MRF regularizer prevents over-excitation artifacts and reduces implausible feature mixtures common to previous dCNN inversion approaches, permitting synthezing photographic content with increased visual plausibility. Unlike standard MRF-based texture synthesis, the combined system can both match and adapt local features with considerable variability, yielding results far out of reach of classic generative MRF methods.", "citation": "Citations (149)", "year": "2016", "departments": ["Mainz Univ., Mainz, Germany", "Mainz Univ., Mainz, Germany"], "conf": "cvpr", "authors": ["Chuan Li.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Li:Chuan", "Michael Wand.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wand:Michael"], "pages": 8}
