A KOR query is to find a route such that it covers a set of user-specified keywords, a specified budget constraint is satisfied, and an objective score of the route is optimized. Consider a tourist who wants to spend a day exploring a city. The user may issue the following KOR query: \u201cfind the most popular route such that it passes by shopping mall, restaurant, and pub, and the travel time to and from her hotel is within 4 hours.\u201d KORS provides browser-based interfaces for desktop and laptop computers and provides a client application for mobile devices as well. The interfaces and the client enable users to formulate queries and view the query results on a map. Queries are then sent to the server for processing by the HTTP post operation. Since answering a KOR query is NP-hard, we devise two approximation algorithms with provable performance bounds and one greedy algorithm to process the KOR queries in our KORS prototype. We use two real-world datasets to demonstrate the functionality and performance of this system.", "citation": "Citations (7)", "departments": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University", "Tongji University", "Nanyang Technological University"], "authors": ["Xin Cao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cao:Xin", "Lisi Chen.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Chen:Lisi", "Gao Cong.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cong:Gao", "Jihong Guan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Guan:Jihong", "Nhan-Tue Phan.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Phan:Nhan=Tue", "Xiaokui Xiao.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/x/Xiao:Xiaokui"], "conf": "icde", "year": "2013", "pages": 4}
