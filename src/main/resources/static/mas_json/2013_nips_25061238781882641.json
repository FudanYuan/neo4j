Transferring knowledge from known categories to novel classes with no or only a few labels is far less researched even though it is a common scenario. In this work, we extend transfer learning with semi-supervised learning to exploit unlabeled instances of (novel) categories with no or only a few labeled instances. Our proposed approach Propagated Semantic Transfer combines three techniques. First, we transfer information from known to novel categories by incorporating external knowledge, such as linguistic or expert-specified information, e.g., by a mid-level layer of semantic attributes. Second, we exploit the manifold structure of novel classes. More specifically we adapt a graph-based learning algorithm - so far only used for semi-supervised learning -to zero-shot and few-shot learning. Third, we improve the local neighborhood in such graph structures by replacing the raw feature-based representation with a mid-level object- or attribute-based representation. We evaluate our approach on three challenging datasets in two different applications, namely on Animals with Attributes and ImageNet for image classification and on MPII Composites for activity recognition. Our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art transfer and semi-supervised approaches on all datasets.", "citation": "Citations (103)", "departments": ["Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society", "Max Planck Society"], "authors": ["Marcus Rohrbach.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rohrbach:Marcus", "Sandra Ebert.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/e/Ebert:Sandra", "Bernt Schiele.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schiele:Bernt"], "conf": "nips", "year": "2013", "pages": 9}
