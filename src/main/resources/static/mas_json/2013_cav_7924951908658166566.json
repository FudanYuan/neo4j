An IMT instance is an Integer Linear Programming instance, where some symbols have interpretations in background theories. In previous work, the IMT approach has been applied to industrial synthesis and design problems with real-time constraints arising in the development of the Boeing 787. Many other problems ranging from operations research to software verification routinely involve linear constraints and optimization. Thus, a general ILP Modulo Theories framework has the potential to be widely applicable. The logical next step in the development of IMT and the main goal of this paper is to provide theoretical underpinnings. This is accomplished by means of BC(T), the Branch and Cut Modulo T abstract transition system. We show that BC(T) provides a sound and complete optimization procedure for the ILP Modulo T problem, as long as T is a decidable, stably-infinite theory. We compare a prototype of BC(T) against leading SMT solvers.", "citation": "Citations (11)", "year": "2013", "departments": ["Northeastern University", "Northeastern University"], "conf": "cav", "authors": ["Panagiotis Manolios.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/m/Manolios:Panagiotis", "Vasilis Papavasileiou.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Papavasileiou:Vasilis"], "pages": 16}
