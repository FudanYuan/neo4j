In model theory, a model companion of a theory is a first-order description of the class of models in which all potentially solvable systems of equations and non-equations have solutions. We show that bisimulation-invariant MSO on trees gives the model companion for a new temporal logic, \"fair CTL\", an enrichment of CTL with local fairness constraints. To achieve this, we give a completeness proof for the logic fair CTL which combines tableaux and Stone duality, and a fair CTL encoding of the automata for the modal \u03bc-calculus. Moreover, we also show that MSO on binary trees is the model companion of binary deterministic fair CTL.", "citation": "Citations (1)", "departments": ["University of Milan", "City College of New York"], "authors": ["Silvio Ghilardi.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Ghilardi:Silvio", "Sam van Gool.....http://dblp.org/pers/hd/g/Gool:Sam_van"], "conf": "lics", "year": "2016", "pages": 10}
